It also said that each year 1.575 mln tonnes or 25 pct of China s fruit output are left to rot and 2.1 mln tonnes or up to 30 pct of its vegetables. The paper blamed the waste on inadequate storage and bad preservation methods. It said the government had launched a national programme to reduce waste calling for improved technology in storage and preservation and greater production of additives.

      " THAI TRADE DEFICIT WIDENS IN FIRST QUARTER Thailand s trade deficit widened to 4.5 billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a year ago the Business Economics Department said. It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht from 58.7 billion. Thailand s improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials  and semi-finished products.  The country s oil import bill however fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices. The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6  billion baht from 56.6 billion. Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower  earnings from many key commodities including rice whose  earnings declined 18 pct maize 66 pct sugar 45 pct tin 26  pct and canned pineapples seven pct. Products registering high export growth were jewellery up  64 pct clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.  \n",

      " JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S.  Japan s Agriculture Ministry angered by  U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market will  tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that  liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan  a senior ministry official said.  Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives  by other suppliers the official who declined to be named  said. Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and  it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise  its farm import market he said.  Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S.  Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open  its wheat market where volume and origin are regulated to  protect local farmers.  Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat  exports as they are more competitive than the U.S. He said.  End-users would also buy other origins grain traders said.  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who is due to  visit Japan for talks between April 16-27 has said he will ask  Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and  remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.  Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market  share here. Australia the largest beef supplier to Japan has  been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year  beef accord next March 31.  Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales  from China and South America while Japanese soybean imports  from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year although  the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.  U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its  beef imports since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain  imports mainly from the U.S. Japanese officials said.  An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when  Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has  the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S.  Agricultural exports with the beef market alone representing  some one billion dlrs in new business.  The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs  and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import  controls on 12 other farm products including fruit juices  purees and pulp tomato juice ketchup and sauce peanuts  prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.  To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S. Japan s  top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove  residual import restrictions on agricultural products.  But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional  reaction and the senior ministry official said the farm issue  should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the  industrial sector.  Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products and these  issues should not be discussed on the same table the official  said.    \n",

      " ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE  The Zambian government has no immediate  plans to follow last week s increase in the producer price of  maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal an  official of the ruling party said.  Last December a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for  refined maize meal a Zambian staple led to food riots in  which at least 15 people died.  That price increase which President Kenneth Kaunda later  revoked followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund  (IMF) to reduce the government s subsidy bill.  However if the producer price rise from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67  dlrs per 90-kg bag is not accompanied by a retail price  increase the government will have to spend more on subsidies  a practice discouraged by the IMF.  There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of  meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the  demands of the IMF and those of the people a Ministry of  Agriculture economist said.    \n",

      " FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED  Argentine grain producers adjusted  their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop  downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the  end of March and beginning of April trade sources said.  They said sunflower maize and sorghum production estimates  had been reduced despite some later warm dry weather which  has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.  However as showers fell intermittently after last weekend  producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain  could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.  Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27  millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province 83 mm in  Cordoba 41 in Santa Fe 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones 95 in  Corrientes eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.  There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.  Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce  rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the  crops including soybean.  However as the lands began drying later in the week  harvesting advanced considerably reaching between 36 and 40  pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.  Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested  material in Cordoba La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield  estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.  The season s sunflowerseed production is now forecast at  2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast  last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of  4.1 mln.  Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares 29.9  to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.  Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area  sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will  begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.  Production estimates for maize were down from last week at  9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated  previously.  This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln  tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and  21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln  tonnes.  Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares two to  seven pct down on last season s 3.85 mln.  Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in  Cordoba Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and  Buenos Aires in mid-April.  The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares 10.3  to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.  The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln  tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week  and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season s 4.1 mln to 4.2  mln tonne crop.  The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted  remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes up 4.2 to 5.5  pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for  1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of  7.1 mln.  The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln  to 3.8 mln hectares 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln  sown in 1985/86.  The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some  areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some  experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas  making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on  this were not available.  Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop which  will be sown between May and August or September has so far  not been as intense as in previous years.    \n",

      " BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS  Storage problems with Brazil s record  grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln  tonnes an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.  Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito speaking from Brasilia  told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this  year s estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.  He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in  harvesting but that most of it would stem from storage  problems.  Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes  theoretically sufficient for the crop.  But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly  distributed. The states of Sao Paulo Parana and Rio Grande do  Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation s capacity but were  responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.  The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West  growing regions where rising production has outpaced storage  capacity.  Brito said the Centre-West whose crops include soya and  maize had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation s grains  production but only 20 pct of its storage space.  In addition to the poor distribution of storage units  there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to  storing grain in sacks while not enough is suitable for  storing loose grain Brito said.  Finally there is a shortage of lorries to transport the  crops.  The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop  has been evident from television reports which have shown  enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.    \n",

      " FAO SEES LOWER GLOBAL WHEAT GRAIN OUTPUT IN 1987  The U.N. Food and Agriculture Organisation  (FAO) said global wheat and coarse grain output was likely to  fall in 1987 but supplies would remain adequate to meet demand.  FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world  grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1 353 mln in 1987 due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet  Union drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.  World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to  rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes softening the  impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly  distributed with about 50 pct held by the U.S.  Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many  developing countries particularly in Africa depend crucially  on the outcome of this year s harvests FAO said.  FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at  a record 2 113 mln tonnes about five pct higher than last  season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986  harvest estimated at 1 865 mln tonnes.  FAO s forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised  upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of  substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.    1\n",

Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87  due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological  sub-divisions of the country.  The report gave the targets for various crops with  estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following  in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60) wheat 49 (49) coarse grains  including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).  Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years it was  possible to maintain higher foodgrain production signifying  growing resilience in agricultural sector the report said.  The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with  greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in  fertiliser efficiency is yielding results it said adding  total foodgrain output in 1985/86 1984/85 and 1983/84  respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes 145.5 mln and a record 152.4  mln.  India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes  of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year  development plan ending March 31 1990  Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the  1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes the gap  of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three  years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more  than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with  good weather the report said.  The major thrust programme will therefore be better water  (irrigation) management. Simultaneously efforts for spread of  improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm  materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be  vigrously pursued it said.    2\n",

The report dated March 24 noted Parana accounts for about  20 to 24 pct of Brazil s total soybean crop.  It said generally favorable weather from early December  through February helped compensate for earlier dryness.  However hot dry weather during the past 20 to 30 days  followed by an unseasonably brief cold spell during the second  week of march has raised concern about late planted soybeans  which are still immature but the impact may be localized the  report said.  The corn crop is expected to be a record and will create  serious storage problems the report said.  Due to favorable support prices corn area increased by  more than 25 pct at the expense of soybeans and yields are  expected to be above average it said.  Due to late plantings only about 20 pct of the corn crop  crop has been harvested.  During the field trip long truck lines were noted at grain  elevators where preference is given to soybeans over corn the  report said.  New crop wheat plantings are expected to decline -- Parana  accounts for about 60 pct of total production.

      " SOVIET UNION TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 86/87-USDA  The U.S. Agriculture Department  increased its estimate of 1986/87 grain purchases by the Soviet  Union to 28 mln tonnes up two mln tonnes from last month.  In its monthly report on the Soviet grain situation the  USDA said imports will be higher than earlier estimated because  Soviet grain buyers have been actively purchasing in the last  month.  USDA said the increased purchasing is somewhat surprising  because of recent higher Soviet crop estimates.  All of the increase in estimated imports will be in corn  USDA said.  Of the 28 mln tonnes total 15 mln tonnes will be wheat 12  mln tonnes coarse grains and the remaining one mln tonnes  miscellaneous grains and pulses USDA said.  USDA noted that the Soviet winter grain crop suffered  through a severe winter and spring field work has been delayed.  The severe winter is believed to have resulted in above  average winter-kill USDA said.  Some grain trade analysts have said abnormal winter losses  maybe one reason why the Soviet Union has been actively buying  grain recently.  USDA said Moscow already has purchased over 25 mln tonnes  grain for delivery in 1986/87 including 14 mln tonnes wheat  and 12 mln tonnes coarse grain.    5\n",

      " U.S. DOLLAR LOSSES PROPEL BROAD COMMODITY GAINS  Commodities from gold to grains to  cotton posted solid gains in a flurry of buying today as losses  in the U.S. dollar and rising interest rates kindled fears of  inflation and economic instability.  Gains were most pronounced on the Commodity Exchange in New  York where gold jumped 12.40 dlrs and closed at 436.50 dlrs a  troy ounce and silver 22.5 cents to 6.86 dlrs a troy ounce.  A key factor behind the advance was anticipation that  inflation will be the only way for the major industrial nations  to halt the slide in the value of the U.S. dollar said Steve  Chronowitz director of commodity research with Smith Barney  Harris Upham and Co. in New York.  The dollar tumbled one day after top finance officials from  the seven largest industrial nations reaffirmed their  commitment to support its value and despite reports of  intervention by the U.S. Federal Reserve Bank traders said.  Traders said it appears that the industrial nations known  as the Group of Seven lack the ability to change the long-term  direction of the currency markets.  Maybe they have some ideas or plans said Chronowitz. If  they do it s not evident.  It looks like there s no cure but to let the free market  take values to where they should be.  One way or another we will force our major trading  partners to stimulate their economies as a measure to correct  the mounting U.S. trade deficit Chronowitz said.  I think the markets believe and have believed for a long  time that the only recourse is to reflate at some point. It s  going to be a long and tedious process but that s what s  happening he said.  The falling value of the dollar makes U.S. commodities  cheaper for foreign buyers stimulating demand.  At the same time traders who are holding stocks and bonds  saw the value of their investments falling and many are turning  to commodities such as precious metals as a hedge said Marty  McNeill a metals analyst in New York with the trading house of  Dominick and Dominick.  The reaction in the metal markets reverberated throughout  the commodities markets as grains livestock and cotton  posted broad gains.  Traders at the Chicago Board of Trade said attention in the  grain markets has shifted from concern about burdensome  supplies to the outlook that a lower dollar will stimulate  export demand.  After the close of trading the Agriculture Department  raised its estimate for grain imports by the Soviet Union by  two mln tonnes from the month-earlier report.  Live hogs and frozen pork bellies posted sharp gains on the  Chicago Mercantile Exchange while live cattle were moderately  higher.  Analysts said several factors boosted hog prices. They said  hogs haven t been making the weight gains that are normal at  this time of year and farmers have been too busy with field  work to market animals.    6\n",

      " DRY SPELL IN PHILIPPINES DAMAGES AGRICULTURE CROPS  A prolonged dry spell has damaged 111 350 hectares of rice and corn plantations in 10 provinces  in the central and southern Philippines agriculture officials  said.  They said some 71 070 tonnes of agricultural produce  estimated at about 250 mln pesos was lost to the lack of  rainfall. They warned of a severe drought if the prevailing  conditions continued until next month.  Agriculture Secretary Carlos Dominguez said he hoped the  losses would be offset by the expected increase in output in  other normally more productive areas not affected by the dry  spell.  Affected were 14 030 hectares of palay (unmilled rice)  representing a production loss of 22 250 tonnes valued at 77.8  mln pesos Department of Agriculture reports said.  About 48 820 tonnes of corn from 97 320 hectares valued at  170.8 mln pesos have also been lost they said.  Officials said the hectarage planted to palay that has been  hit by the drought accounted for only one pct of national total  thus the damage is considered negligible.  In the case of corn they said the loss can be filled by  production from non-traditional corn farms which diversified  into the cash crop from sugar two years ago.  The Philippine Coconut Authority said coconut production  in the major producing region of Bicol might drop by 25 pct to 320 000 tonnes if the dry spell continued. There were no  reports of actual damage.    7\n",

      " AWB CHAIRMAN URGES FARMERS NOT TO CUT PLANTINGS  Australia could lose valuable wheat  markets through lack of availability if plantings for the  coming 1987/88 season are significantly reduced Australian  Wheat Board (AWB) chairman Clinton Condon said.  If predictions of a 30 pct decrease in plantings prove  true Australia may not be able to supply wheat to some of its  valuable markets he said in a statement.  Condon did not say who had made the predictions but an AWB  spokesman said there was a general industry feeling that  farmers hard hit by low prices and rising costs could cut  back plantings sharply. Wheat sowing normally begins in May.  However Condon said he did not believe plantings would be  cut by as much as 30 pct although he realised many farmers were  facing enormous financial pressures.  He said the AWB expects the area sown to be about 10.7 mln  hectares down from 11.3 mln in 1986/87 when the crop was about  16 mln tonnes. Final crop estimates for 1986/87 and planting  intentions for 1987/88 are not yet available.  If the AWB is unable because of a short-term cut in  plantings to meet the needs of the markets it has developed  with much time and effort it may have great difficulty selling  wheat to those markets in the future Condon said.  Markets which rely on a steady supply of Australian wheat  understand a decrease in production due to drought but they  will have difficulty understanding a deliberate decision to  decrease production Condon said.  If Australia wants wheat to continue as a major export  income earner governments and government authorities will need  to closely examine ways of contributing to the continuing  viability of the wheat industry he added.  Australia s leading wheat markets include China Egypt  Iran Iraq the Soviet Union and Japan.    7\n",

USDA reduced the price of hard red winter wheat at Kansas  City and Texas by six cents at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32  cents and at St Louis by nine cents Ralph Klopfenstein deputy  administrator of commodity operations at the Agricultural  Stabilization and Conservation Service said.  The department also lowered the terminal price of hard red  spring wheat at Minneapolis and Duluth by 32 cents he said.  In addition USDA cut the Pacific Northwest price of hard  red spring wheat by 31 cents USDA officials who asked not to  be identified said.  The officials said hard red spring wheat prices at Chicago  Denver and Toledo were adjusted by about the same amount as at  Pacific Northwest Duluth and Minneapolis.  The price changes should lead to a pickup of PIK and roll  activity Klopfenstein said. The price change was decided upon  last week and will be effective today he said.  Klopfenstein also said the department raised the premiums  on high protein wheat to offset the drop in low protein wheat  prices meaning the net price on any wheat commanding a protein  premium would remain unchanged.    7\n",

The report said the assessment was based on travel in the  two countries from March 30 to April 4.  It said crop conditions were better than earlier expected  following the extreme dry conditions last fall and the  prolonged winter temperatures this spring.  However in general plant development was at least three  weeks or more behind normal this spring and conditions varied  greatly by regions the report said.  Fields seeded during the optimum period last fall and  especially those receiving supplemental irrigation water (about  65 pct of the fields observed) appeared to be in good  condition with little evidence of winterkill while others  varied considerably the report said.

The official who was not named said a large corn shortage  and corruption among customs and Coast Guard personnel have  jeopardised the government s ban on corn imports which was  aimed at saving foreign currency.  The newspaper quoted NFA Marketing Director Jig Tan as  saying monthly corn consumption stood at about 331 000 tonnes  against a national stock inventory of 191 732 tonnes.  Tan said a continuing drought affecting about 49 150  hectares of corn has led to the loss of 43 725 tonnes of corn  worth 174.9 mln pesos and contributed to the shortage.  The newspaper quoted Linda Geraldez an NFA statistician  as saying despite the drought and the shortage the total  inventory at the end of the January/June crop season is  expected to be at least 201 000 tonnes.    8\n",

      " CHINA PROVINCE BECOMES GRAIN IMPORTER  The south China province of Guangdong is  importing millions of tonnes of grain a year from overseas and  other parts of China because farmers have switched from grain  to more profitable crops the Peking Review magazine said.  The official magazine said the province s grain area fell  to 4.33 mln hectares in 1985 from 5.7 mln in 1978 out of a  total farmland area of 7.4 mln hectares.  Farmers have switched to cash crops such as sugarcane  bananas oranges papaya and freshwater fish-farming in part  to supply major consumer markets in Hong Kong and Macao the  magazine said. It gave no 1986 area figures.  The magazine said China aims to keep 80 pct of national  farmland under grain 10 pct under cash crops and 10 pct under  other crops although the ratio will vary from place to place.  It said primitive cultivation methods labour-intensity and  low productivity make grain the least profitable farm  commodity. Farmers in one central region of China can from 0.1  hectare earn 2 250 yuan a year from vegetables 375-450 yuan  from cotton or 225 yuan from grain it added.

The Cereals Intervention Board ONIC Wheat Producers  Association and the National Union of Agricultural and Cereal  Cooperatives have not yet forecast 1987/88 exports or  end-of-season stocks.  However the officials said the USDA s figure of end  1987/88 stocks at 5.03 mln tonnes against 1986/87 s 2.87 mln  was not surprising given a record high yield forecast in April.  The French Feed Cereals Research Institute ITCF forecast  in mid-April an average yield of 6.58 tonnes per hectare for  soft wheat in 1987/88 compared with 5.6 tonnes in 1986/87 and  the record high yield of 6.5/6.6 tonnes in 1984.  This would result in a French soft wheat harvest of around  31 mln tonnes against 25.5 mln in 1986/87 given a Ministry of  Agriculture estimate of area planted of 4.66 mln hectares  against 4.61 mln in 1986/87.  ONIC s first preliminary forecast of the 1987/88 campaign  will be released at the beginning of September an ONIC  official said.  Soft wheat exports in 1987/88 were extremely difficult to  estimate at this stage both within the European Community and  to non-EC countries an ONIC official said.  He said however that among countries to which France  could increase its wheat exports were Egypt and the Maghreb  countries (Morocco Algeria and Tunisia) he said.  The USDA s forecast of an 11.65 mln tonne maize crop in  1987/88 against 11.48 mln in 1986/87 while again premature  was not out of line with estimates of the French Maize  Producers Association AGPM an AGPM official said.  Maize plantings would be down in 1987/88 but yields were  expected to be higher the AGPM official said.  It estimated 1987/88 maize plantings of 1.73 mln hectares  down seven pct from the 1.87 mln hectares planted in 1986/87.    8\n",

      " ZAMBIA CUTS PRICES AS TROOPS PATROL COPPERBELT  The Zambian government today announced  minor price cuts for essential commodities as part of its new  economic strategy while police and troops patrolled the  northern Copperbelt to prevent any outbreaks of rioting.  However staple foods such as bread sugar and maize meal  were not affected by the cuts and many people said this could  provoke trouble from disgruntled elements who had expected more  sweeping reductions.  Observers in the capital expressed disillusionment with the  small extent of the price cuts which ranged up to 10 pct on  items such as blankets soap detergents and baby food.  Residents in the Copperbelt contacted by telephone said  government forces had set up roadblocks around the main towns.  In Lusaka business went on as usual and there was no sign  of troops or police reinforcements on the streets.  President Kaunda had ordered the price reductions to take  account of lower import costs following the revaluation of the  kwacha to a fixed rate of eight per dlr from 21 on May 1.  The revaluation formed part of a new go-it-alone economic  strategy which Kaunda adopted to replace Zambia s IMF austerity  program.  Labour leaders in the Copperbelt said last week gangs of  unemployed youths were being formed in the politically volatile  region to take action against shops that did not reduce their  prices after today s deadline.

Agriculture Minister Achmad Affandi in written remarks  distributed today as Indonesia s 14 foreign donor nations met  at The Hague said The general argument presented by the Bank  for this free trade open economy view is weak.  The Bank called for overhauls in how Indonesia manages the  largest farm area in South-east Asia and said agricultural  growth was stagnating under subsisides for rice farming.  The Bank report said Indonesia s rice production had peaked  and the subsidies are a waste of money.  Affandi replied that rice is the main staple and provides  an income for 17 pct of the workforce. The subsidies were  needed to support the fertilizer industry including importers  exporters producers and distributors he said as well as  assisting in small part the majority of Indonesian farmers.  Affandi agreed with a bank recommendation that farmers  should be free to choose their own crops but he said the  government would continue to maintain production targets for  strategic commodities such as rice and sugar.  The Bank report was especially critical of Indonesia s  drive to plant sugar saying domestic sugar prices are double  the world average because of inefficiencies and the country  would save money by importing the commodity.  However Affandi said volatile world sugar prices the need  to save foreign exchange and an already up-and-running sugar  industry were good arguments for continuing the sugar drive.

      " BUDGET PACT CUTS U.S. FARM FUNDS 1.25 BILLION DLRS  U.S. House and Senate budget  negotiators agreed as part of an overall budget accord reached  yesterday to cut 1.25 billion dlrs from fiscal 1988 spending  on agricultural programs Congressional sources told Reuters.  The agreed cut in farm programs is a compromise between 1.4  billion sought by the Senate and one billion by the House.  The negotiators also agreed to cut 1.6 billion from the  farm budget in fiscal 1989 and 2.45 billion in 1990 for a  total of 5.3 billion in saving over three years sources said.  The agreement presents the House and Senate Agriculture  committees with difficult choices on how to make changes in  agriculture programs that achieve the budget savings targets  without jeopardizing popular support payments senior  Congressional aides told Reuters.  Some farm state lawmakers already are manuevering to find  the budget savings.  Rep. Dan Glickman D-Kan. Chairman of the House grains  subcommittee has introduced a bill which would freeze wheat  and corn loan rates for the 1988 crop at the current 2.28 dlrs  and 1.92 dlrs respectively saying it would save 500 mln dlrs.  House Agriculture Committee chairman Kika De la Garza has  said the committee will consider the Glickman proposal.  But Congressional sources said the proposal is unlikely to  be approved because of opposition from Republican lawmakers and  a strong stance by Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who said  freezing loan rates would send the wrong signal to other major  grain export competitors and would not achieve the budget  savings Glickman claims.  Another area where Glickman and other have said budget  savings might be made is to increase acreage reduction program  ARP levels for wheat and corn.  However on this issue also Lyng has taken a strong stand  within the Reagan administration arguing that the 1988 crop  wheat acreage reduction should be left at 27.5 pct and not 30  pct as sought by the Office of Management and Budget OMB. Most  commodity lobbyists expect Lyng to prevail.  Congressional sources said the only way to achieve  significant budget cuts through ARP increases would be to boost  the 1988 corn ARP. But one informed Congressional source said  singling-out corn for an ARP increase would would be seen as  unfair to one commodity.  Congressional sources said the areas where Congress is most  likely to eventually look for budget savings are some  tightening of the payment limitation rules and possible  adoption of a 0/92 program for the 1988 crops of major grains.  Those changes would achieve a portion of the 1.25 billion  but not enough they said.  Ultimately Congressional sources said the agriculture  committees may be forced to apply an across-the-board cut on  all Commodity Credit Corp. payments to farmers including price  support loans and deficiency payments similar to the  Gramm-Rudman-Hollings budget cut applied in fiscal 1986.  This idea has been suggested by the American Farm Bureau  Federation AFBF as the fairest approach for all commodities.    10\n",

      " SENATOR DEFENDS U.S. MANDATORY FARM CONTROL BILL  Sen. Tom Harkin D-Iowa defended his  controversial mandatory supply control farm bill and said U.S.  farmers should be allowed to vote in a referendum whether they  approve of the proposal.  The Harkin proposal would set loan rates of 5.17 dlrs per  bushel for wheat 3.77 dlrs for corn and 9.32 dlrs for  soybeans all to be put in effect under strict controls on  planted acreage reductions. Present loan rates are 2.28 dlrs  for wheat 1.92 for corn and effectively 4.56 for soybeans.  Also under the plan the U.S. would seek a world market  sharing cartel with the European Community and other exporting  nations to share-out export markets Harkin said during the  first of several Senate Agriculture subcommittee hearings  examining farm programs.  Harkin made the following claims in testimony on his  Family Farm Act.  -- The mandatory control bill would increase farm income  and reduce government spending on agriculture.  -- Harkin said his policy of high price supports would not  ruin U.S. agricultural exports as critics claim but would  increase overall revenue from exports.  This would be done by seeking agreement among major  exporting countries including the European Community on market  sharing at agreed high prices.  Sen. Christopher Bond R-Mo. countered during the hearing  that such a grain export cartel is not workable.  -- Harkin acknowledged that higher commodity price supports  would be passed onto consumers but he said high food prices  stem more from gouging by food processing companies than from  high farm product prices.  Harkin cited what he termed excessive net returns on  equity over five years of 33.4 pct at Kellogg 31.9 pct  Monfort 22.8 pct Nabisco 22.8 pct ConAgra 21.2 pct H.J.  Heinz 19.1 pct Ralston Purina 17.2 pct Pillsbury and 16.7 pct  Quaker Oats.  -- Harkin said a legitimate concern about his bill would  be the impact of higher prices on livestock producers.  He said as a transition to the higher prices he would  allow livestock producers to purchase Commodity Credit Corp.  grain stocks for three years.  Thereafter livestock farmers would benefit from a  predictable and stable grain price he said.  -- Harkin said that under his policy approach farm  participation would be no more mandatory than the current  farm program. He said farmers now must participate in farm  programs in order to receive credit for planting and to protect  farm income.    11\n",

Secretary for Finance and Economic Planning Kwesi Botchwey  made the announcement last night while accepting 7 891 tonnes  of rice worth about four mln dlrs under a Japanese food aid  programme.  The lifting of the ban imposed earlier this year follows  government concern over lower than average rainfall in southern  Ghana and its implications for the major harvest.  Botchwey said rain has been lacking in major cereal growing  areas throughout the south this year. The Ministry of  Agriculture has predicted a fall of at least 25 pct in all  major staple crops including maize rice and cassava.  GNA quoted Botchwey as saying that while the consequences  of current reduced rainfall will be nowhere near the drought  experiences of 1982/83 the government has taken steps to  alleviate anticipated food production shortfalls.

There is going to be more rain for the next two three  days he said. We re in a fairly wet pattern with normal to  above normal moisture this week.  Mohler said rainfall averaged 1/2 inch across southern  Minnesota 3/4 inch over southwest Iowa one inch in eastern  Nebraska and 1-1/2 inches in south-central Nebraska.  Illinois fields saw virtually no rain over the weekend but  were receiving scattered thundershower activity today he said.  Rain patterns will move across Indiana to Ohio with  thudershower activity yielding to more general rains he said.  Tomorrow that eastern area will get 1/4 to one inch a  pretty good rain Mohler said.  Rain was heavier than expected over the weekend sparking  an early selloff in soybean futures at the Chicago Board of  Trade. Prices were off 14 to 20-1/2 cents with November off  19-1/2 cents at 5.43-1/2 dlrs.  Mohler said the cold front now over the eastern belt is  expected to move over the central Midwest then move north  later in the week. That could bring new rain patterns across  the Corn Belt and assure good crop conditions as  early-developed corn moves into the crucial pollination stage  in early July he said.    12\n",

Commerce and Planning Minister Mahbubul Haq said in a  televised speech the government had also decided to allow  duty-free import of cotton yarn to make the textile industry  more competitive and to link bulk tea imports to the export of  Pakistani products.   Cotton and rice are Pakistan s main exports which have  been handled exclusively by state corporations since early  1970s.  But Haq said now the private sector would also export  cotton and rice along with the corporations which meets a  long-standing demand of the local traders.  The duty-free import of cotton yarn has been allowed to  bring down prices and help the local ancillary industries  compete effectively in the world market he said.   Haq said the new policy effective from the fiscal year  1987/88 beginning on July 1 would be for three years but  reviewed every year.  It was a departure from the previous practice of announcing  trade policies for a single fiscal year and Haq said it would  enable the businessmen to plan their market strategies over a  longer period.  He said an export credit of 250 mln dlrs had been provided  for the export of engineering goods to selected third world  countries on soft credit terms.   Pakistan s 1986/87 exports at 3.6 billion dlrs 18.2 per  cent more than in the previous year and imports at 5.23  billion dlrs compared to 5.63 billion dlrs in 1985/86.  He said the government policy was to rationalise and  streamline import controls.  It has been observed that due to restrictions on imports  specially on raw materials and intermediate goods local  industry has been suffering for want of necessary inputs he  said. Prices have been on the increase and quality of goods  produced has been low. This restrictive policy also gave rise  to smuggling and hampering of exports.   He said that to correct this situation 136 items had freed  from import restrictions.  Previously Pakistan has met its trade gap largely from  remittances from its nationals working abroad mainly in the  Gulf. However the remittances have begun to fall after the  drop in oil prices in recent years leading to the spectre of a  balance of payments crisis for Pakistan.    12\n",

The two sides usually try to meet as each new year of the  agreeement approaches although the last meeting was delayed up  to last February. However any delay this year should not  endanger the fifth year of the grains agreement that extends  through September 1988 USDA officials said.  It will be difficult to pull together the people for the  meeting during July an aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel  Amstutz said.  Since the last meeting was only around four months ago the  next talks could still be a couple more months he said.   There has been grain industry speculation that the USDA  will offer Moscow another wheat subsidy during the next  marketing year. But USDA officials said even if consultations  were held soon a subsidy offer would probably not be made.  I doubt that there would be any subsidy offer this summer  or before the next agreement year begins a USDA source said.  Citing limited subsidy funds and uncertainties about next  year s crops he said There are too many variables now. It  would be uncharacteristic of us to make an offer now.

      " NO PRESSING NEED FOR SOVIET WHEAT SUBSIDY - LYNG  The Soviets have not indicated an  urgent need for a U.S. wheat subsidy offer and it is unlikely  that such an offer will be ma during the U.S./Soviet summit  expected to be held next month Agriculture Secretary Richard  Lyng told Reuters.  In an exclusive interview with Reuters Lyng said he did  not know if the United States will offer Moscow another wheat  subsidy offer this year or when that offer will be made.  Last year it was well into the year before we offered it.  There s been nothing that s taken place to indicate to me that  there s a pressing need on their part for that sort of deal (a  wheat subsidy).  When asked if a subsidy would be offered at a U.S./Soviet  summit Lyng said No I don t think so. I don t think that.  The Agriculture Secretary said a U.S. wheat subsidy deal to  Moscow would not be the kind of topic appropriate for  discussion at a summit.  It would not be the kind of issue that the President or the  Chairman would get into specific negotiations or discussions  about Lyng said.  When Mr. Nikonov (communist party secretary for  agriculture) was here ... he indicated that trade in wheat was  not something that would be discussed with the President of the  United States. He said it s not presidential Lyng said.  Lyng said uncertainties about wheat quality in some major  producing areas of the world volatile wheat prices and the  still unfinished Soviet grain harvest could delay any final  decision on the timing of another wheat subsidy to Moscow.  The future of the U.S./Soviet long-term grains agreement  will be discussed the first of next year Lyng said but the  Agriculture Secretary questioned the benefits of the  long-standing agreement.  We ve had three years in a row in which the Soviets have  failed to live up to their end of the agreement ... We would  love to continue to keep doing busines with the Soviet Union  but do we need a long-term agreement. Who benefits from that.  These are some of the questions we need to discuss.  When asked if he felt the United States has benefitted from  the agreement Lyng said I don t know. It certainly hasn t  been what we had hoped it would be.

      " EC AGREES TRADE DEAL WITH ARGENTINA  The European Community (EC) agreed a  trade deal with Argentina designed to compensate the country  following the entry of Spain and Portugal into the group EC  officials said.  Under the deal agreed by EC foreign ministers Argentina  will gain additional trading rights on a series of products  including meat fish and cereals by-products.  But ministers failed to agree on new trade deals with  Canada and Japan and are due to study these again the  officials said.  The deal with Argentina was agreed by a majority of EC  states after West Germany withdrew objections to increased  quotas for Argentina on high-quality beef.  Ireland and France continued to oppose the deal on meat  saying that the main dispute was over sales of cereals  substitutes but they were outvoted by the other states the  officials said. Under the deal Argentina will benefit from  improved quotas on exports of beef to the EC. In particular the  quota on high-quality Hilton beef will be raised by 4 500  tonnes to 34 300 tonnes and quotas on frozen boneless beef will  be increased by 3 000 tonnes to 53 000 tonnes.  Argentina will also benefit from an additional quota of 5 000 tonnes of frozen hake fillets at 10 pct duty and reduced  levies on 550 000 tonnes of wheat bran the officials said.  The improved trade terms were offered after Argentina said  that Spain and Portugal s entry into the EC affected their  exports of cereals substitutes to these two countries. They  have been negotiated under the rules of GATT (General Agreement  on Tariffs and Trade).  But officials said ministers had been unable to resolve  Canadian claims that its sales of certain fish to Spain had  been affected by the country s EC membership.  Officials said the EC had asked GATT to arbitrate on the  fish dispute with Canada.  Ministers also decided to continue talks with Japan. The EC  claims that Spain and Portugal s entry into the group has  improved trade conditions for Japan but has been unsatisfied  with Japanese offers of compensation.  Japan s main offers were to improve inspection systems on  citrus fruits to aid EC exports to improve tariffs for some  other farm produce to increase tariffs for leather footwear  and to offer better trade terms for Spain and Portugal.  EC External Trade Commissioner Willy De Clercq told  journalists: We maintain our position that the (Japanese)  concessions were not enough.

      " SOVIET 1988 GRAIN TARGET INDICATES 1987 OUTPUT  Recent announcements from Moscow of  next year s grain production targets indicate that the Soviets  are estimating this year s grain crop at 205 to 213 mln tonnes  Agriculture Department analysts said.  USDA is projecting the Soviet crop at 210 mln tonnes but  some earlier estimates from Soviet officials were that the 1987  grain crop could match the 1978 record of 237 mln tonnes.  Moscow outlined its economic targets for 1988 on Monday  putting the grain harvest goal at 235 mln tonnes. An analyst of  Soviet agriculture at USDA noted that a recent article in  Izvestia said Soviet grain production in 1988 is planned to be  25 to 30 mln tonnes more than expected this year.  This indicates that their own estimate is for a 205 to 213  mln tonne (grain) crop the analyst said.   In calculating Moscow s crop estimate USDA used the 235  mln tonne production goal as well as a 238 mln tonne figure  published in a Soviet economic journal this month.  USDA s production estimate of 210 mln tonnes reflects a  range of 207 to 212 mln tonnes a USDA source said.  Late season rains damaged Soviet crops slowed harvest  progress and lowered Soviet production analysts said.  While in the U.S. earlier this month Soviet agriculture  official Viktor Nikonov predicted that the grain crop would be  as good or better than last year s 210 mln tonne harvest.  A member of Nikonov s party commented that although 230 mln  tonnes of grain were in the fields harvest problems would  bring the final crop down to around 210 mln tonnes.    14\n",

      " SOVIETS OUTLINE 1988 ECONOMIC TARGETS  The Soviet Union outlined its economic  targets for 1988 on Monday stressing the need to improve  standards in the country s sluggish engineering industry.  Planning chief Nikolai Talyzin told the Supreme Soviet  industrial output should rise by 4.5 pct in 1988 up from a  planned 4.4 pct in 1987. It rose 3.6 pct in Jan-Sept 1987.  Talyzin said national income the nearest Soviet equivalent  to gross national product should rise by 4.3 pct against a  planned 4.1 pct this year. Gross national product measures the  output of a country s goods and services.  He said the Kremlin planned to produce 235 mln tonnes of  grain in 1988 versus a planned 232 mln this year. Moscow  produced 210 mln tonnes in 1986.  Kremlin leader Mikhail Gorbachev has described  machine-builing as a sector whose rapid modernization is  essential if the Soviet Union is to compete effectively on  world markets.  Certain difficulties have arisen this year in the  machine-building industry. The economy is not receiving a  considerable amount of the equipment that it requires said  Talyzin who heads the state planning committee GOSPLAN.  Soviet data show the machine-building industry which makes  machine tools instruments and other engineering goods  increased output by 3.3 pct in the first nine months of 1987  compared with the same period last year.  However this was far below the 7.3 pct increase planned  for the industry for the whole of 1988.  Talyzin said the ruling Politburo had concluded at a recent  meeting that an improvement in economic performance depended to  a large extent on conserving resources better. Large-scale  measures are planned to save resources he said.  Finance Minister Boris Gostev told the Supreme Soviet that  defense spending in 1988 would total 32 billion dlrs the same  figure as was announced last year.  Western governments view official Soviet estimates for  defense spending as highly understated but say the real figure  is hard to calculate because Soviet military industries are  intertwined with the civilian economy.  Talyzin said the Kremlin also decided to increase spending  next year on medical services education pensions and social  insurance schemes.    14\n",

The harvest will be China s second highest in history but  poor weather and low incentives for grain-producing farmers  have kept yields down earlier Chinese press reports said.  Industry sources expect China to import at least 10 mln  tonnes of grain this year because of the harvest shortfall.  Chinese customs figures showed grain imports of 9.59 mln  tonnes in the first eight months of 1987 compared with 6.09  mln in the same 1986 period.

      " FRANCE WILL FIGHT EC FARM PROPOSALS - MINISTER  French Agricultural Minister  Francois Guillaume warned that France would flatly reject  proposed reforms of the European Community EC cereals sugar  and oilseeds sectors which he said would disrupt these  markets.  The EC Commission s proposals to shorten the intervention  period and lower monthly premiums for cereals and increase the  financial burden on the sugar producers will also result in  lower real prices for producers he told farmers here.  I give you my word that France while it will not reject  technical adjustments or serious discussion will simply reply  in the negative to these bad reforms Guillaume told the annual  conference of the country s major farm union FNSEA  (Federation Nationale des Syndicats Dexploitants Agricoles).  Community agricultural ministers are due to meet again  Monday to try and agree a package of reforms to curb spiralling  EC output and fix farm prices for 1987/88.  Relations between the government and farmers have become  strained in France in recent months.  There have been sporadic but frequent demonstrations by  farmers protesting over sharp falls in meat and pork prices and  further cutbacks in Community milk output.  But Guillaume s warning that he would reject reorganisation  of the EC cereal and sugar markets -- France being a major  producer of both crops -- won him warm applause from the  FNSEA s farmers.  His pledge to fight the EC proposals and push for the  complete dismantling of the system of cross border taxes  designed to smooth out currency differences known as Monetary  Compensatory Amounts MCA s however are unlikely to avoid  further protests by producers.  Farm leader Raymond Lacombe said the union planned to go  ahead with a series of major protests both in France and abroad  against the EC Commission s proposals to overhaul the farm  sector.  The Minister s proposals back up our determination to  organise union action in the coming weeks he told reporters  adding that this could also act in Guillaume s favour on a  ministerial level.  Guillaume was head of the FNSEA for many years before being  appointed farm minister last spring.  Lacombe refused to say whether the farmers felt that  Guillaume was doing a good job as farm minister.  There have been certain advances on cutting production  costs reducing fiscal costs and awarding drought aid but  there are still areas where more could be done such as on  farmers indebtedness he said.  Guillaume told the conference the government will make  available 2.4 billion francs (396 mln dlrs) to help producers  reduce milk output and to encourage older farmers to retire.  The government has already announced financial aid for the  milk sector and it was not clear how much of the package  announced today was new aid Lacombe said.    15\n",

      " INDIA STEPS UP COUNTERTRADE DEALS TO CUT TRADE GAP  India is searching for non-communist  countertrade partners to help it cut its trade deficit and  conserve foreign exchange.  Wheat tobacco tea coffee jute engineering and  electronic goods as well as minerals including iron ore are  all on offer in return for crude oil petroleum products  chemicals steel and machinery trade sources told Reuters.  Most of the impetus behind countertrade which began in 1984 comes from two state trading firms -- the State Trading  Corp (STC) and the Minerals and Metals Trading Corp (MMTC).  The two state trading corporations are free to use their  buying power in respect to bulk commodities to promote Indian  exports a commerce ministry spokeswoman said adding that  private firms are excluded from countertrading.  One trade source said India has targetted countries that  depend on an Indian domestic market recently opened to foreign  imports.  However countertrade deals still make up only a small part  of India s total trading and are likely to account for less  than eight pct of the estimated 18.53 billion dlrs in trade  during the nine months ended December the sources said.  Countertrade accounted for just five pct of India s 25.65  billion dlrs in trade during fiscal 1985/86 ended March  against almost nothing in 1984/85 official figures show.  However the figures exclude exchanges with the Eastern  Bloc paid in non-convertible Indian rupees the sources said.  Total trade with the Soviet Union involving swaps of  agricultural produce and textiles for Soviet arms and crude  oil is estimated at 3.04 billion dlrs in fiscal 1986/87  against three billion in 1985/86.  Indian countertrade which is being promoted mainly to help  narrow the country s large trade deficit is still  insignificant compared with agreements reached by Indonesia  Venezuela and Brazil the trade sources said.  The trade deficit which hit an estimated record 6.96  billion dlrs in 1985/86 is expected to decline to 5.6 billion  in the current fiscal year.  But the push to include non-communist countries in  countertrade is also due to other factors including the slow  growth of foreign reserves a tight debt repayment schedule  shrinking aid and trade protectionism businessmen said.  One source said India is showing more dynamism in promoting  countertrade deals than in the past when the deals were made  discreetly because they break GATT rules. As a member of the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) India cannot  officially support bartering.  The MMTC s recent countertrade deals include iron ore  exports to Yugoslavia for steel structures and rails.  MMTC s recent global tenders now include a clause that  preference will be given to parties who accept payment in kind  for goods and services sold to India a trade official said  adding that the policy remains flexible.  We also take into account other factors such as prices at  which the goods and services are offered to India the trade  official said.  Early this year the commerce ministry quietly told foreign  companies interested in selling aircraft ships drilling rigs  and railway equipment to India that they stood a better chance  if they bought Indian goods or services in return the trade  sources said.  Illustrating the point the official said a South Korean  firm recently agreed to sell a drilling platform worth 40 mln  dlrs to the state-run Oil and Natural Gas Commission.  In return the South Koreans gave a verbal assurance to buy  Indian goods worth 10 pct of the contract against the 25 pct  sought by New Delhi the trade official said.  We selected the Korean firm because its bid was the lowest  he added.  Countertrade is helping African countries short of foreign  currency to import goods. India has signed a trade protocol to  buy up to 15 000 tonnes of asbestos fibre from Zimbabwe in  exchange for Indian goods including jute bags and cars.  But despite India s new drive countertrade has some  inherent problems they added.  It is not always easy to meet the basic requirement that  the trade should always be balanced one trade source said. The  other problem is it is often difficult to supply or buy  commodities which the other party wants.  Another added Barter is also restrictive. We look upon it  as a temporary measure to get over the current balance of  payments difficulty.  This is why countertrade has not been made a law in India.  It does not even figure in the country s foreign trade policy.    15\n",

USDA last night notified the grain industry that effective  immediately all gulf differentials used to price interior corn  would be widened on a sliding scale basis of four to eight cts  depending on what the differential is.

      " COLD AIR A THREAT TO SOME U.S. HARD WHEAT AREAS  A cold air mass working its way  south from Canada may pose a threat to developing hard red  winter wheat in Oklahoma according to Eugene Krenzler wheat  specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative Extension.  There is some threat. Some of the crop is far enough along  so that it s probably vulnerable Krenzler said.  Accu Weather meteorologist Dale Mohler said cold air moving  from the north could put temperatures in the middle 20 s  fahrenheit as early as tonight depending on development of a  low pressure area over southeast Colorado which could stall the  system.  If impeded by the low-pressure area the cold air could hit  Oklahoma and Texas as late as Monday morning. Temperatures  could stay in the mid-20 s for up to eight hours Mohler said.  Krenzler said less than 10 pct of the Oklahoma wheat crop  has advanced to boot stage. The closer to that stage the more  vulnerable the head of the wheat is to cold weather he said.  We can handle probably an hour or so down to 25 or 26  degrees (fahrenheit) Krenzler said as long as we don t have  a lot of wind.  If we do get six hours down below 25 degrees I d say we  have a good chance of significant damage to the heads he  said.  Krenzler said early planted stands in the north-central and  southwestern parts of the state are probably most vulnerable.  Crops in the panhandle of Oklahoma and Texas are less developed  and have some snow cover protection from the cold he noted.    16\n",

      " U.S. SEES MORE HARMONY IN TALKS WITH FRANCE  The U.S. Expects more harmonious  talks than usual during French Prime Minister Jacques Chirac s  first official visit this week as frequently rancorous disputes  between the two countries begin to fade.  The Libyan bombing is a thing of the past the trade war  didn t happen and we have reached reasonably good cooperation  on terrorism one U.S. Official told Reuters.  It looks like a reasonably harmonious visit in prospect  more harmonious than usual.  Since taking office a year ago Chirac has been obliged to  deal with a series of potentially serious disputes with the  United States.  During the U.S. Bombing of alleged terrorist targets in  Libya last April France refused to allow British-based U.S.  Planes to overfly its territory forcing them to take a  circuitous route. That angered Washington.  The U.S. Officials who asked not to be identified said a  year ago Washington felt the French were not taking strong  enough action against terrorism. Now they are. We re pleased  and they are pleased that we are pleased one said.  More recently a dispute over U.S. Access to the grain  markets of Spain and Portugal after they joined the European  Community threatened to become a trade war.  In retaliation for what Washington saw as deliberate  Community moves to exclude U.S. Grain the United States was  poised to impose swingeing tariffs on European Community food  imports and a major trade war was averted at the last minute.  Last week the forces of President Hissene Habre of Chad  supported trained and armed by Paris and Washington scored a  major success by pushing Libyan troops out of their last bases  in northern Chad.  A French official added: There is also a common interest in  getting Japan to cut its trade surplus with the rest of the  world by opening up its markets.  Although relations have improved markedly between the two  countries many irritants remain. At the top of the list is the  Community s common agricultural policy (CAP).  To Washington as one official put it CAP is the root of  all evil in international food trade because it subsidises  farmers and sells vast amounts of excess produce at below world  prices thereby eating into U.S. Markets.    16\n",

      " SRI LANKA APPEALS FOR DROUGHT RELIEF AID  Sri Lanka has appealed to 24 countries  for emergency aid to help 2.4 mln villagers affected by the  country s worst drought in 36 years government officials said.  Embassies received letters over the weekend outlining aid  needed for a sixth of Sri Lanka s population in 13 districts.  The letter said the government had to step in to avert  serious economic hardship and because the Social Services  Ministry had already used up its entire 1987 budget provision  of 23 mln rupees by distributing help to the worst hit areas.  The letter said 548.76 mln rupees were needed for a six  month period at least until the May-September (Yala) rice crop  was harvested. Over 25 000 tonnes of wheat rice flour and  other cereals were required it said along with supplies of  sugar lentils dried or canned fish and milk.  In some of the most seriously affected districts the Maha  (October 1986-April 1987) crop had been almost completely  devastated the letter said. Maha paddy output was now  estimated at 70 mln bushels 20 mln less than originally  expected.  There were two scenarios for the Yala crop with a high  forecast of around 40 mln bushels conditional on adequate  rainfall within the next three to four weeks.  Should the present drought continue however production is  estimated at around 20 mln bushels the letter added.  Total estimated paddy output for 1987 would be between 90  and 110 mln bushels or 1.35 to 1.65 mln tonnes of rice. Last  year s output was 124 mln bushels down from 127 mln in 1985.  The letter said villagers in most seriously affected  districts had been deprived of any means of subsistence because  subsidiary crops had also failed.  It said the government s current budget did not permit it  to provide sustained and adequate relief to those affected.  Revenue has been adversely affected by depressed commodity  prices and slowing of the economy. Defence commitments continue  to exert pressure on the expenditure side.  The 548.76 mln cash would cover payments of 150 rupees per  month for each family as well as handling transport and  distribution of emergency food. But such an outlay of funds by  the government would not be possible without seriously  impairing development projects or greatly fuelling inflation  in the economy the letter said.  The letter said the Food Department would be able to  release wheat and rice from the buffer stock to meet the  immediate cereal requirements provided such stocks are replaced  subsequently.  The Meteorological Department said the country was  experiencing its worst drought since 1951 and the four-month  dry spell prevailing in most of the areas would only break when  the monsoon rains fell in late May.  The letter said some areas had been experiencing the  drought since August and in the rice growing district of  Kurunegala there had been no effective rainfall since June 1986    17\n",

The report dated February 26 said there is evidence of  delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall  because of dry conditions.  However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have  promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on  last fall s late seeding it said.  Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the  situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out  of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early the  report said.  Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage  under these conditions they said.

      " COMMODITY PACTS MORE ORIENTED TOWARDS MARKET  Consuming countries chastened by the  collapse of International Tin Council (ITC) price support  operations in 1985 are insisting more than ever before that  commodity pacts reflect the reality of the markets they are  serving a Reuter survey showed.  They want price ranges to be more responsive to market  trends - to avoid overstimulating output and straining the  accords support operations - and intervention rules that avoid  the risk of exports by non-members undermining the pacts.  Consumers and producers mindful of ITC buffer stock losses  have also sought strict conditions for buffer operations.  Importers and some key exporting countries have shunned a  generalised approach to commodity price stabilisation and  prefer to assess each commodity case by case the survey  showed.  The International Cocoa Organization (ICCO) last week set  precise limits on what the Buffer Stock Manager (BSM) could do  under the new agreement. It imposed daily and weekly purchase  limits prohibited the BSM from operating on futures markets  and stipulated after consumer insistence that up to 15 pct of  total buffer stock purchases could be of non-member cocoa. This  will help prevent lower quality cocoa from Malaysia the  world s fourth largest producer undermining the market.  The cocoa pact establishes precise differentials the Buffer  Stock Manager must use when purchasing varying grades.  A new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) was  adopted earlier this month in Geneva. Importing and exporting  countries agreed several changes to make the reference price  more responsive to market trends and they eliminated provisions  under which the buffer stock could borrow from banks to finance  operations. Direct cash contributions from members will fund  buffer stock purchases. Bank financing was a particular feature  of the failed ITC buffer stock which suffered losses running  into hundreds of millions of sterling. Legal wrangles continue.  Recent International Coffee Organization (ICO) negotiations  in London exemplified the degree to which consumers insist that  agreements reflect market reality commodity analysts said.  Consumers and a small group of producers argued that  objective criteria should be used to define export quota  shares which would have meant a reduction in the share of  Brazil the world s leading producer. Brazil wanted to maintain  its previous quota share of 30 pct. The talks broke down and  although an ICO executive board meeting starts in London today  delegates and trade sources see chances of any near term  negotiations on export quota distribution as remote.  International agreements exist for sugar and wheat. These  do not have any economic clauses but provide a forum for  discussions on possible future economic agreements collect  statistics and draw up market analyses. Analysts said  differences between sugar exporting countries have held up any  progress towards an accord with economic teeth while sheer  competition between major exporters amid a world grain glut  militate against any pact with economic provisions for wheat.  An alternative focus for commodity discussions are  international study groups made up of governments with advice  from industry such as those for lead and zinc and rubber.  The U.N. Common fund for commodities with a planned  directly contributed capital of 470 mln dlrs has failed to  become operational because neither the U.S. Nor the Soviet  Union has ratified it. U.S. Officials in Washington said the  U.S. Doubts the fund would be able to fulfil its objectives  citing the lack of widespread support.  U.S. Officials in Washington and Malaysian officials in  Kuala Lumpur expressed a policy of looking at each commodity  pact case by case. U.S. Officials said it has been willing to  study individual cases for economically sound market-oriented  commodity accords balancing producer and consumer interests.  We see little to be gained by attempting to increase the  price of a commodity whose long-term trend is downward  official Administration policy states. The U.S. Currently  belongs to only two international commodity agreements that  have economic clauses - the International Coffee Agreement  (ICA) and INRA - but it is also a member of the sugar and wheat  pacts.  The U.S. Did not join the International Cocoa Agreement  because it considered its proposed price ranges unrealistic and  not designed to protect the interests of consuming countries  the State Department said. U.S. Officials singled out the INRA  as the one commodity agreement that seems to be working.  U.S. Negotiators were successful in getting other members  of the pact to agree that the price review and adjustment  mechanism of the rubber agreement would accurately reflect  market trends and also to continue the accord as a market  oriented agreement U.S. Officials said.  Canadian officials in Ottawa also said they have  consistently tried to look at membership of commodity pacts on  the merits of each case. Malaysian Primary Industries Minister  Lim Keng Yaik told Reuters in Kuala Lumpur his country the  world s top producer of rubber tin and palm oil decides its  participation in international commodity pacts case by case.  Malaysia is a member of the Association of Tin Producing  Countries (ATPC) which produce 65 pct of world tin. The ATPC  launched a plan to limit member tin exports to 96 000 tonnes  for a year from March to cut the tin surplus to 50 000 from 70 000.  Economist in the West German Ministry of Agriculture and  delegate to cocoa wheat and sugar agreements Peter Baron told  Reuters in London Agreements with economic clauses to  stabilise prices could function if fixed price ranges were  close to market reality if there was full participation by  producers and consumers and if participants were prepared to  take their obligations in the framework of the agreement  seriously.  But Baron added No real sanctions are available for a  country that doesn t stick to its obligations...The German  approach is sceptical. We don t think agreements are the best  instrument to help developing countries. They were never meant  to be a vehicle for the transfer of resources and that is how  developing countries often interpret them.  Traditionally Britain has always been supportive of  commodity agreements reflecting its strong links with Third  World producing countries. But recently demands for more  stringent and justifiable pacts with emphasis placed on the  need for intellectual honesty and objective criteria have  grown.  British officials stress the need for commodity pacts to be  a two way partnership in trade rather than a disguise for aid.  It is now seen as essential that any pacts involving direct  market participation through a buffer stock have a high degree  of transparency and do not contain the risk of open-ended  borrowing that occurred in the tin pact they said. U.K.  Delegates talk of stabilisation and the need for prices to  reflect changes in market structure and price trends rather  than dictate what prices should be.  A Foreign Ministry official in Tokyo said Japan urges price  realism in commodity pacts adding high prices inflate supply.  A government spokesman in Paris said France is favourable  to commodity pacts. France a large consumer and producer of  sugar favours a sugar pact as long as it reflects the real  market situation particularly regarding stocks.  Indonesia s Foreign Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja told  Reuters in Jakarta: These agreements can work as long as the  problems are cyclical..But it s another matter when there are  structural problems..But we are still committed to commodity  agreements as an act of faith. Nicaraguan External Trade  Minister Alejandro Martinez Cuenca said in London producers  cannot afford not to give their backing to commodity  agreements.  The political will is not there on the part of some  consumers to make agreements work Martinez Cuenca said.  The head of the economics department in the Brazilian  Foreign Ministry Sebastiao do Rego Barros told Reuters an  agreement can be successful if it keeps a link with market  reality. If you have an agreement such as coffee with a system  of quotas with a link between prices practised inside the pact  and actual market prices it can work. UNCTAD spokesman Graham  Shanley said consuming countries realise steady export earnings  enhance developing countries ability to service debt and mean  greater demand for industrialised nations capital goods.    18\n",

      " KANSAS EXCHANGE HITS CFTC POSITION LIMIT PLAN  The Kansas City Board of Trade  KCBT has asked federal futures regulators to modify a proposal  to raise the Chicago Board of Trade s CBT speculative  position limits on wheat futures contracts saying the plan  would put the the Kansas exchange at a serious competitive  disadvantage.  The Commodity Futures Trading Commission CFTC last month  proposed raising CBT wheat speculative limits to 1 200  contracts all months net from 600 contracts and to 900  contracts for any single month from 600 contracts.  At the same time CFTC proposed leaving KCBT s wheat  speculative position limits unchanged.  Higher limits for CBT wheat than for KCBT wheat would  significantly impair the KCBT s ability to compete with the CBT  for speculative interest Michael Braude president of the  Kansas exchange said in a letter to CFTC.  A CFTC spokesman said the commission took into account open  interest affected by existing speculative limits in proposing  to raise CBT s limits.  KCBT said the CFTC proposal would reduce hedging  efficiency constrain growth of intermarket spreading and of  the exchange s wheat options contract and impair its ability to  attract large speculators.  The Kansas City exchange asked the commission to amend its  proposal to change the limits for KCBT wheat to the exact same  bushel amount as specified for CBT wheat.  CFTC will consider public comments on the proposal until  June 3.    18\n",

      " WEATHER HURTING YUGOSLAV WHEAT - USDA REPORT  Unfavorable late winter weather  conditions in the main wheat growing areas of Yugoslavia  indicate dimmed prospects for the emerging winter wheat crop  the U.S. embassy s agricultural officer in Belgrade said.  The officer who travelled through an area from Belgrade to  Subotica said in a field report dated March 27 the wheat crop  had been set back at least three weeks because of a cold spell  that followed a period of warm weather.  He said unseasonably warm weather in late February that  brought the wheat crop out of winter dormancy early was  followed by three weeks of unusually cold weather.  Damaging effects were seen in the fields most of which  show stands with a yellow-brown cast indicating extensive leaf  and possible root damage from repeated freezings he said.  The report said that since much of the early growth in  February was from late seeding rather than from normal  development his view was that the damage may be more extensive  than some local observers say.  The most seriously affected fields were late-seeded fields  on normal maize soils. Stands in these fields were thin and  chances of recovery appeared less favorable he said.  However he said soil moisture conditions were favorable  and many of the fields had already been top-dressed which  would aid recovery.    19\n",

In a field report the officer said indications were that  winter kill might well be more than 100 000 hectares compared  with 38 000 last year.  He said the damage was probably more limited in southern  and central regions and most widespread in the north.  Damage was most severe on plants above the ground where  little or no snow cover was present he added.  The officer said heavy frosts at night followed by sunshine  during the day led to some heaving particularly for well  developed plants and for winter barley.  Furthermore as the ground surface thawed some standing  water occurred in the fields.  The officer said repairing damage will probably call for  special measures this spring in fields with damaged plants and  where stands are thin. Harrowing as well as well-timed  applications of nitrogen will be necessary he added.    19\n",

      " GRAIN REPORTS IMPROVE U.S. FARM OUTLOOK-ANALYSTS  The U.S. grain planting intentions and  stocks reports bear optimistic news for U.S agriculture a  grain analyst on a Chicago Board of Trade panel said.  The decline in intended soybean acreage and lower stocks  are the first report we ve had for a long time that shows any  optimism for anybody said John Bud Frazier grain analyst  and executive vice president for Balfour MacLaine Inc.  I m really excited about it Frazier said.  The U.S. Department of Agriculture said farmers intend to  plant 67.6 mln acres of corn down from 76.7 mln planted last  year and 56.8 mln acres of soybeans down from 61.5 mln.  The report showed March 1 stocks of 1.4 billion bushels of  soybeans 8.3 billion bushels of corn and 2.3 billion bushels  of wheat all below trade guesses.  Frazier was joined by Susan Hackmann senior grain analyst  with AgriAnalysis and Mark Meyer a grain analyst with  Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. on a Chicago Board of Trade  panel to discuss the reports.  Frazier said the stocks reports in particular were friendly  for the market and soybean prices would jump three to five  cents a bushel if the bell rang right now.  We re getting our disappearance up. We have less (corn and  soybeans) than we thought we had he said noting that hog and  poultry production is up.  We re seeing low prices generate some interest in demand  said Meyer adding that feed use was up 13 pct last quarter and  15 pct in the preceding quarter.  However Hackmann said production could continue to exceed  consumption.  She noted that most of the reductions in soybean acres came  in southeastern states where yields are usually low.  We have the potential for record breaking soybean yields  this year (which) will temper the enthusiasm on tomorrow s  opening she said.  Hackmann said record corn yields also are possible and the  crop could reach 7.1 billion bushels which would be down from  last year s 8.25 billion bushels.  We ll need very good disappearance next year to reduce  stocks she said. The USDA estimated disappearance last year  at 6.7 billion bushels.  Hackmann said the stocks report was positive for the long  term But we still have a long way to go to bring stocks down  to where we could start rebuilding prices.  Frazier also cautioned that the soybean acreage report  could prompt farmers to change their plans and plant more  soybeans.  The panelists agreed that the reports should discourage  talk of revising the 1985 farm bill.  There seems to be no desire ... to change the farm law  we re working under today and this report should reinforce  that Frazier said.  We are seeing the program beginning to work said Meyer.    20\n",

      " ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA MUST PRESERVE FARMLAND  If we go on using up  farmland as we have done since 1980 there will be none left in  20 years to grow grain on.  Xu Jinfeng a middle-aged official in Fengbang village on  the edge of Shanghai sums up the dilemma China faces as it  tries to feed its more than one billion people and at the same  time let them get richer by building factories and new homes.  China has to feed one quarter of the world s population  but only one seventh of its land is arable.  Sharp increases in farm output since 1979 turned China into  a net grain exporter for the first time in 1985 and again in 1986  But the rapid industrialisation of the countryside which  has occurred at the same time has gobbled up arable land for  factories and homes for peasants who can now afford them.  Official figures show that China lost just under one pct of  its arable land to other uses in 1985 and a slightly smaller  amount last year. It gained 26 mln new mouths to feed during  the two years.  We lost very little land prior to 1980 when the  industrialisation began official Xu said. Since then nearly  all the families in the county have built new homes and many  factories have gone up.  Last year we lost land to a new railway line Xu said. But  land losses in future should fall because nearly all families  already have new houses she added.  The issue of land loss is a matter of major concern to the  Peking leadership which announced earlier this month that  China will issue nationwide quotas for conversion of grain land  for the first time this year.  The present situation of abusing occupying unlawfully  wasting and destroying land and land resources is serious said  an article in the official press explaining the new measures.  It has resulted in great losses of cultivated farmland it  said. China has a large population and its land resources are  badly deficient.  An official of the Shanghai city government said county  authorities could approve conversion of only 0.3 hectares of  arable land to other uses while anything more than that must  be approved by the city government.  The Peking government faces another major obstacle in its  efforts to ensure China s people get enough grain to eat. The  prices the state pays to farmers for grain are too low making  it more profitable for them to grow other crops.  To offset this the state offers farmers cheap fertiliser  and diesel oil and payment in advance for grain it contracts to  buy. The state then sells the grain at subsidised prices to  China s 200 mln city residents. Rural factories also subsidise  grain output paying farmers bonuses to grow it.  Some officials argue that the simplest solution to the  problem would be for the state to raise city grain prices.  Chen Zuyuan Communist Party secretary of a village in the  eastern province of Zhejiang said the government listened too  much to the demands of selfish city people and could raise city  grain prices without any problem.  But the government has ruled out a price rise. Raising the  price of grain would directly conflict with the goal of social  stability said a China Daily editorial this month.  The Shanghai official said prices must be reformed over the  long term. We must be very careful. We have a very large  population which is used to price stability and will object to  price rises he said. The problem is how to do it.  The Shanghai official said a rise in grain prices might  also affect the prices of hundreds of food products made with  grain and consumed by city residents.  In addition the state faces the problem of inadequate  investment by farmers in land and in grain in particular.  The official press has reported that farmers fear farm  policy may change and they are putting their new wealth into  building graves memorial halls for ancestors and homes.  Under reforms introduced in the late 1970s farmers sign  contracts with the state requiring them to grow certain crops  but they have considerable freedom in how to use their land.  As the expiration date of the 15-year contract is almost at  the halfway mark farmers are beginning to worry about the  future the China Daily said in an editorial last month.  Their anxieties stem from the fact that they are allowed to  use the land but not own it. For most of the period of  Communist rule the land was organised into collectives where  there was little room for individual initiative.  New measures are needed to reassure them of the consistency  of government policies and make them interested in long-term  investment the newspaper said.    20\n",

      " CHINA OFFICIAL CONDEMNS GOVERNMENT GRAIN POLICY  The grain output of a major Chinese  grain-producing province is not increasing because farmers  lack incentives production costs are rising storage  facilities are poor and there is not enough state investment in  grain the province s vice-governor said.  The China Daily quoted Yang Jike vice-governor of Anhui  as saying farmers could earn twice as much growing cotton as  they could growing grain and three times as much growing cash  crops like flax. He said production costs had risen to 40 pct  of farmers earnings from 20 pct in 1982 and lower investment  had caused the area of irrigated land to fall.  Yang said investment in agriculture fell in 1985 to 9.9 pct  of the province s total investment from 26 pct in 1978.  He said an estimated 1.5 billion yuan worth of grain was  hit by mildew or rot in state granaries every year and a  further 1.5 mln tonnes was eaten annually by rats.  He said government measures to deal with the problem dealt  with trifles rather than the essentials. He called for more  investment in grain production an immediate ban on illegal use  of or damage to farmland and a reversal of what he called the  tendency to rely on grain imports.  The New China News Agency quoted Zhang Yan a delegate to  the National People s Congress attacking grain policy. He said  the government had cut agricultural investment to three to four  pct from 11 pct.  With the abundance of grain and cotton in the past few  years some people got carried away relaxing their attention  to grain and cotton production he said.  On Saturday vice-premier Tian Jiyun said China aimed to be  self-sufficient in grain. Now it exports corn from the  northeast but it imports wheat.  Grain consumption is rising every year. Even if we reach  the 1987 target of (405 mln tonnes) it cannot be considered  adequate Tian said.    20\n",

      " SHULTZ USSR TRIP FUELS TALK OF EEP WHEAT OFFER  Speculation the United States will  offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union appears to have  reached a new level of intensity in the run-up to Secretary of  State George Shultz visit later this month to Moscow.  Rumors of an impending deal have coursed through wheat  markets since officials from the two countries held their  customary semi-annual grain talks in February. Moscow s  decision at that time to reenter the U.S. corn market  strengthened the perception of warming farm trade prospects.  Shultz is set to arrive in Moscow April 13.  Shultz statement two weeks ago that he would not stand in  the way of a wheat subsidy offer under the Export Enhancement  Program EEP coupled with the announcement of his visit to  Moscow was interpreted by many grain trade representatives  here as a clear signal that the Reagan administration was  preparing an offer.  Administration officials -- in and out of the U.S.  Agriculture Department -- have been extremely tight-lipped  about the prospects of a subsidy offer.  But USDA officials for the most part have abandoned the  contention the proposal is dormant suggesting that an offer  while not a done deal is a live possibility.  Prominent U.S. grain trade representatives -- many of whom  asked not to be identified -- continue to maintain that an  offer to subsidize four mln tonnes of wheat is imminent.  Others who one month ago claimed a deal was not possible  are saying they would not rule one out.  Rep. Pat Roberts R-Kan. yesterday went so far as to  predict a subsidy offer would be made within the next ten days  to two weeks.  Aides to Roberts said he had spoken to Republican leaders  who had been in contact with administration officials.  Richard Fritz director of international marketing at U.S.  Wheat Associates said he was confident an export enhancement  offer would be made by the middle of this month.  Fritz also said he thought the value of the bonus would end  up being close to the offer Washington made Peking earlier this  year when USDA approved subsidies to China of around 36 dlrs  per tonne on one mln tonnes of wheat.  Some grain trade representatives say a four-mln-tonne wheat  subsidy offer might help stimulate more Soviet purchases of  U.S. corn and open the door to U.S. sales of soybeans.  As ever one of the crucial sticking points in a wheat deal  would appear to be price.  Last summer the administration took the controversial step  of offering the Soviets subsidized wheat -- but were  embarrassed when Moscow spurned the proposal on the grounds  that the 15-dlr-per-tonne subsidy still left U.S. wheat prices  far above world market prices.  The administration s decision to set the subsidy level up  front instead of accepting bids from exporters appeared to be a  means of controlling the price while attempting to dampen  criticism grain trade sources said.  Nonetheless the pricing procedure did not prevent Shultz  from saying the Soviets were chortling because Washington was  offering Soviet housewives cheaper grain than that available to  U.S. housewives.  The conventional wisdom among grain trade representatives  here is that a general warming of relations between the two  countries since last summer combined with continued hard times  in the U.S. grain belt would favor a subsidy offer.  In addition the USSR has made it clear it would consider  buying U.S. wheat if it were priced more competitively.  However observers have not forgotten the circumstances  surrounding the administration s announcement of the wheat  subsidy offer last summer.  Up until the time of the announcment congressional and  industry leaders were led to believe the White House had  decided to expand the Export Enhancement Program to include not  only the Soviets but also a much broader list of countries.  Instead the administration scaled back the offer to  include only the Soviets.  That last-minute change of heart adds a measure of  uncertainty even to the predictions of those most convinced  that the administration will not now pass up the opportunity to  sell four mln tonnes of wheat to the Soviet Union.    22\n",

      " U.S. SAID PROMISED BULK OF MAIZE EXPORT TO SPAIN  The U.S. Has been promised a near  monopoly of maize exports to Spain from third countries  guaranteed under an agreement with the European Community an  EC official said.  The official who asked not to be named told Reuters that  the guarantee was given in an unpublished clause of the  agreement.  Under the accord which began in January third countries  were guaranteed access for the next four years for two mln  tonnes a year of maize to the Spanish market as well as 300 000 tonnes of sorghum.  However the official said the U.S. Had been assured that  almost all the exports would be reserved for its traders.  The EC Commission is to ask member states to agree either a  tender system to fix reduced import levies for the maize or to  authorise direct imports by the Spanish intervention board.

      " SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987  Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or  exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year  the Oil World newsletter said.  Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce  soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.  At least 500 000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the  European Community and South America in the January/March  quarter with additional large quantities likely to be imported  in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil it  said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding  periods of 1986.  The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of  probably 250 000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed  and large scale butter imports that were expected from March  onward it said.  Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain  area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the  recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.

      " HEAVY RAINS DAMAGE ARGENTINE COARSE GRAINS CROP  Fresh heavy rains caused further  damage to the Argentine 1986/87 coarse grains crop in the week  to yesterday particularly in Buenos Aires province trade  sources said.  They said the sunflower maize soybean and sorghum crops  were damaged and yield estimates affected. New production  forecasts were made for all these crops.  The rains over the weekend and up to yesterday registered  more than 200 mm on average in western Buenos Aires and  worsened the flooding in various parts of the province.  The weather bureau said the rains which in Buenos Aires  have surpassed 750 mm in the last 30 days could continue.  The northeast of the country was also hit by heavy rains.  In Corrientes province the rains also passed an average of  200 mm in some parts notably the Paso de los Libres area  bordering on Uruguay.  In Santa Fe and Entre Rios provinces they were over 100 mm  in places in Misiones and San Luis 90 mm and in Cordoba 80 mm.  The rains were less intense in Chaco and Formosa.  Harvesting in areas not actually under water could also be  further delayed due to dampness in the earth the sources said.  The excessive humidity might also produce rotting of the  crops further dimishing the yield the sources added.  Sunflower harvesting before the weekend rains reached 26 to  30 pct of the area sown in Santa Fe Cordoba La Pampa and  Buenos Aires provinces.  The production forecast for 1986/87 sunflowerseed has been  lowered to between 2.2 and 2.4 mln tonnes against 2.3 to 2.6  mln tonnes the previous week making it 41.5 to 46.3 pct lower  than the record 4.1 mln tonnes produced last season.  The area sown was two to 2.2 mln hectares down 29.9 to  36.3 pct on the record 3.14 mln hectares in 1985/86.  The maize harvest advanced to within 26 to 28 pct of the  area sown in Cordoba Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires. It  will begin in La Pampa within about 10 days weather  permitting.  Maize yield this season is now estimated at 9.6 to 9.9 mln  tonnes against last week s 9.9 to 10.1 mln tonnes down 21.4  to 22.6 pct on the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes at which private  producers put 1985/86 production.  The new forecast is 22.7 to 25 pct down on the official  figure of 12.8 mln tonnes for last season s production.  The grain sorghum harvest reached 17 to 19 pct of growers  targets against 14 to 16 pct the previous week.  The production forecast was reduced to between three and  3.3 mln tonnes against 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes last week 21.4  to 26.8 pct down on last season s 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.  The area sown with sorghum in 1986/87 was 1.23 to 1.30 mln  hectares down 10.3 to 15.2 pct on the 1.45 mln in 1985/86.  The forecast for soybean yield this season was the least  changed in relation to last week. It was put at a record 7.5 to  7.7 mln tonnes against the previous 7.5 to 7.8 mln tonnes.  These figures are 4.2 to 5.5 pct higher than last season s  record of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes according to private sources  and 5.6 to 8.5 pct up on the official 7.1 mln tonnes.  The adjustment to the production forecast is due to the  rains and overcast conditions which have greatly reduced the  sunlight needed for this crop sources said.  Producers fear estimates may yet have to be adjusted down  further.  The humidity could induce rotting and growers are still  finding more empty pods due to excessively dry weather earlier  in the season.  Soybean harvesting is due to start in mid-April in southern  Cordoba and Santa Fe and northern Buenos Aires.    22\n",

      " ANALYSTS SAY USSR MAY PREFER NEW CROP U.S. WHEAT  The Soviet Union would likely be more  interested in purchasing new crop wheat than in booking any  grain for immediate shipment if offered a subsidy on U.S.  wheat an executive with a major grain export company said.  Lower prices and the desire to delay any big purchases  until the condition of winter and spring crops is better known  make new crop wheat more attractive said George Hoffman  director of commodity analysis for The Pillsbury Company.  Pillsbury is assuming that they (Soviets) will be offered  a subsidy and that it will be a subsidy that they can respond  to Hoffman told Reuters in an interview at an agribusiness  education conference here. But if there are too many  constraints placed on a subsidy offer the USSR will take less  than an anticipated four mln tonnes he said.  Hoffman said Pillsbury s internal statistics put Soviet  Union wheat purchases at only two mln tonnes under a subsidy  offer. However if a subsidy is offered at competitive levels  Moscow would likely buy more he said.  If we give the Soviets the same deal as the Chinese I  expect they ll take it said Vernon McMinimy director of  commodity research for A.E. Staley Manufacturing Co.  McMinimy told Reuters spring weather and its impact on  crops will determine how much wheat Moscow would buy under a  subsidy offer.  Soviet winter crops did not get off to a good start because  of a dry autumn last year and because of the severe winter  they probably have had more damage due to winter weather than  normal McMinimy said.    23\n",

Dan Glickman D-Kan. also  would increase funding for the program to 2.5 billion dlrs from  1.5 billion now.  Furthermore the committee passed an amendment offered by  Rep. Glickman which instructs the U.S. Agriculture Department  to value EEP bonus commodities at market value not acquisition  value. Glickman said the change would make the program 30 pct  less expensive to operate.  The provision on EEP wheat to the Soviet Union offered by  Rep. Bob Smith R-Ore. does not require the administration  make an offer but urges such action.  The committee approved an amendment offered by Rep. Glenn  English D-Okla. requiring the Secretary of Agriculture to  begin discussions with other major grain producing countries  aimed at jointly reducing world grain production.  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter yesterday opposed the  amendment saying such commodity agreements do not work.  Among the host of amendments to restrict imports approved  by the panel the most significant would require quotas on  imports of goods containing more than 25 pct of a bulk farm  product that is subject to U.S. quotas. The amendment offered  by Rep. Arlan Stangeland R-Minn. is aimed primarily at  curbing imports from Canada of products containing sugar and  foreign foods containing dairy products. It also may affect  peanut cotton and tobacco imports Committee sources said.  Another amendment would place a quota on U.S. imports of  casein a dairy product shipped to the U.S. primarily by New  Zealand and Ireland.  The panel also voted to apply to lamb imports the same  countercyclical import quota law which is operating for U.S.  beef imports.  Other miscellaneous amendments included:  -- Urging the administration consider retaliating against  Japan and South Korea if those countries do not remove  restrictions on beef imports.  -- Boosting the amount of U.S. grain which must be shipped  each year under a food aid program called Section 416 to 800 000 tonnes from 500 000 tonnes now.  -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary conduct a study of  the Canadian Wheat Board import licensing system for wheat to  determine if it is a non-tariff trade barrier.  -- Requiring the Agriculture Secretary reimburse the  National Corn Growers Association up to 500 000 dlrs for the  costs of defending the U.S. feedgrains program against a  Canadian countervailing duty case this year.  -- Urging the administration oppose the Canadian decision  to apply a duty on U.S. corn imports and a proposal by the  European Community to apply a vegetable oils tax.  -- USDA conduct a study of the findings of a National  Commission on Agricultural Export Policy which recommended a  reorganization of USDA s trade policy apparatus.    23\n",

      " AWB CALLS FOR TIGHTER WHEAT QUALITY CONTROLS  Australia is risking wheat export  sales by not providing enough specific quality grades to meet  buyer requirements the Australian Wheat Board (AWB) said.  Many AWB customers are becoming increasingly quality  conscious demanding strict adherence to contractual quality  specifications the board said in a submission to the Royal  Commission into Grain Storage Handling and Transport.  Many of the specifications are more specific than the  current categories used in Australia it said.  The commission is trying to identify ways of saving costs  and boosting efficiency of the grain handling system.  Australia must rely on quality to retain its wheat market  share because its competitors are supplying cheaper but  lower-quality grades the AWB submission said.  It stressed the need to segregate wheat categories at every  stage from receival to shipping.  Better industrial relations at grain terminals more  uniform transport systems across the states and extensive stock  control were vital to improved marketing it said.  The submission also said Australia s federal system impeded  the AWB s role of coordinating and managing the marketing of  wheat.  The AWB called for an end to physical and legislative  constraints at state borders that prevent the efficient  transport of grains to other states for shipment.  It is essential that wheat moves by the most economic mode  to the nearest efficient port irrespective of the state in  which the wheat is grown or stored it said.  For example wheat grown in northern New South Wales (NSW)  might move more efficiently to Brisbane in Queensland than to  Sydney or Newcastle in New South Wales it said. Similarly  southern NSW wheat might better be shipped to Portland or  Geelong in Victoria.  Legislation giving state rail authorities a monopoly over  grain shipments was one notable impediment it said.  The AWB said the current approach of state-based bulk  handling authorities is not essential although it said it  favoured the authorities maintaining at least their current  level of control of storage and transport as long as quality  was maintained.  An appendix on port loading costs showed it cost between 26 500 and 34 700 U.S. Dlrs to load a 50 000-tonne vessel at  various Australian ports compared with 21 200 dlrs at Houston  and 16 300 at Port Cartier Quebec for a 60 000-tonner.    24\n",

      " JAPAN STUDY URGES FOREIGN ACCESS TO FARM MARKETS  Japan should increase foreign access to  its farm products market while encouraging further development  of domestic agriculture a government report said.  The white paper on agriculture for the year ended March 31  said active participation in writing world farm trade rules at  the next round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT)  talks will help prepare Japan to improve access.  Agriculture Ministry sources said the paper marked an  easing in Japan s tough position on agricultural imports which  stressed the need for strict controls on some products to  maintain self-sufficiency in food.  Japan now produces only 30 pct of its annual grain needs  down from 61 pct some 20 years ago official figures show.  The paper said Japanese agriculture has been slow to  improve productivity and demand/supply imbalances.  The relative shortage of farmland in Japan is mainly  responsible for higher domestic prices it said.  The strong yen has meant lower input material prices but  has also resulted in higher agricultural imports which has  worsened working conditions among part-time farmers the paper  said.  This could make it difficult to improve the industry s  structure the paper said.  To solve these problems and to reduce farm product prices  to more reasonable levels Japan should try to restructure the  the agricultural sector to improve productivity and make it  self-supporting it said.    25\n",

      " PAKISTAN NOT SEEN AS MAJOR WHEAT EXPORTER  Pakistan is not emerging as a major  wheat exporter as world market prospects are not good enough  Sartaj Aziz Special Assistant on Food and Agriculture to the  Pakistani Prime Minister said in an interview.  No exports are planned for the next 12 months or so and  plans last year to sell one mln tonnes to Iran came to nothing  because they could not agree a price he said.  Aziz forecast that Pakistan may have exportable surpluses  of one mln tonnes or a half mln tonnes over the next few  harvests in years when the weather is favourable.  The government does not wish to increase output much above  this because of low world prices and the land would be better  used for other crops.  Aziz said the Pakistani government does not want area sown  to wheat to increase from the current seven mln hectares. Some  10 pct of that area which gives low yields could be switched to  more profitable crops such as oilseeds.  The aim is to concentrate on raising yields from the  current 1.8 to 1.9 tonnes per ha to at least 2.5 tonnes per ha  over the next five to seven years he said.  Aziz said the current 1986/87 crop harvesting of which is  just beginning is expected to yield around a record 14.5 mln  tonnes. This compares with a target of 14.7 mln and last year s  yield of 14.0 mln.  He said rains some six weeks ago helped the crop but more  recent rains reduced prospects slightly.  The long-term wheat production target is for some 17 mln  tonnes by mid-1993 taking into account Pakistan s annual  population growth rate of more than three pct. Current  consumption is some 12.5 mln tonnes.  The current wheat reserve is 2.5 mln tonnes Aziz said.  This compares with a minimum reserve commitment of one mln  tonnes which Pakistan will maintain at all costs and a  strategic reserve target of two mln tonnes.  Despite the fact that stocks are a half-mln tonnes over  target the surplus will not be exported at present he said.  The government wants to keep an extra safety margin until  it sees what effect the abolition of a 44-year-old wheat  rationing system will have on domestic consumption. New exports  will be considered only in about a year s time when the 1987/88  crop can be gauged as well he said.  The new domestic policy introduced on March 15 is for the  government to supply unlimited quantities of wheat at two  rupees per kilo. With other costs this means a price in  Pakistani markets of between 2.30 and 2.50 rupees per kilo.  Under the old system introduced during World War Two and  due to be phased out by April 15 some 50 mln ration cards were  issued enabling poor people to buy wheat cheaply.  Aziz said following the introduction of a government  support price in the 1970s the system become so corrupted that  only 20 to 25 pct of subsidised wheat was actually reaching the  consumer the rest being diverted illicitly to the mills.  The ration system had also not had the stabilising effect  on the internal wheat market that was intended Aziz said.  Prices have already begun to fall with the introduction of  the new system. The wheat price in Karachi the most expensive  Pakistani city had dropped from 3.11 rupees per kilo on March  1 to 2.85 rupees on March 30.  Aziz said he does not expect the change in system to have a  major effect on total consumption but it may encourage better  use of side-products such as bran.    25\n",

      " EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND  The European Commission s decision to  release an additional 300 000 tonnes of British intervention  feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate  relief in an increasingly tight market traders said.  Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage  pointing out that at this week s U.K. Intervention tender the  market sought to buy 340 000 tonnes but only 126 000 tonnes  were granted.  The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to  satisfy demand they said and keen buying competition for  supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm.  The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong  representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission.  There has been growing concern that rising internal prices  triggered by heavy exports were creating areas of shortage in  interior markets.  The latest EC authorisation will add 70 000 tonnes at the  April 14 tender and a further 30 000 tonnes later in the month.  The remaining 200 000 tonnes will be made available in May and  June.  News of the release produced an early downward reaction in  local physical markets but by midday some sections had halved  early two stg losses while others were unchanged.  Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln  tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the  free market. However some traders believe these figures are  overstated and while some may still be held on the farm the  bulk of wheat is already sold. Some of the grain is also off  the market in futures stores.  A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been  sold for export or to the home market since the season started  July 1 leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59  mln tonnes.  Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln  tonnes leaving about 753 000 tonnes traders said.  This season s U.K. Export performance has surpassed all  early expectations and has created the present nervous  situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market  supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in  August.  The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total  barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes a new  record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes  achieved in the 1984/85 season.  Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and  barley around 4.50 mln tonnes.  The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln  tonnes of British wheat and barley this season but only 1.28  mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25 traders  said.  Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British  grain and for the July 1/March 25 period had taken 2.59 mln  tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley. This compares  with 1.28 mln and 868 700 tonnes last season.  The market is expecting prices particularly wheat to stay  buoyant for the remaining few months of the season. If supplies  become more difficult and prices strengthen further feed  compounders may increase cereal substitute usage traders said.    26\n",

      " SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE  Soviet winter grains could be off to  a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall  and cold winter weather and crop analysts said.  Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the  Soviet Union appear dim at this point but it is premature to  forecast any major crop problems analysts said.  But the situation bears careful watching over the next six  weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and  future buying plans analysts of the Soviet Union said.  From a weather standpoint you can say with certainty that  the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a  lower crop (than last year) Gail Martell chief meteorologist  for E.F. Hutton said.  The next six weeks in the USSR s grain growing areas will  be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of  the winter crops Martell and other analysts said.  Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of  us an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.  The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares  of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill.  This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop  and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years the  USDA analyst said.  With a timely spring Soviet farmers would probably be able  to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops but analysts  noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops  -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.  Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover  combined with cold temperatures. This winter however  snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent  so the bulk of winterkill analysts speculate likely has been  due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.  Fall dryness may be a problem. There s a good correlation  between mediocre crops and fall dryness Martell said.  Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal  in southern and northern Ukraine and below normal over the  entire winter crop area she said.  Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the  snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill Jim Candor senior  forecaster for Accu Weather said.  Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the  fall and winter analysts said.

      " LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS STRONG EXPORTS - USDA  Rising demand for U.S. rice may  gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help  increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite  sluggish trade this year the U.S. Agriculture Department said.  In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary the  department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the  1986/87 marketing year causing stocks to fall about 10 mln  hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on  July 31.  Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is  expected to decline this year the report said.  USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain  acreage have turned around. Domestic prices of medium grain  relative to long grain have increased the loan differential  has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields  relative to those of other classes have leveled off.  With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the  marketing loan domestic rice use is expected to grow at a  faster rate USDA said.  Development of new products and increased promotion have  helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of  consumers USDA said.  USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because  of large production and stocks but a weaker market should  affect competing exporters more than the U.S.  The United States has already recovered a substantial share  of the European Community market and made inroads into markets  in the Middle East and Africa the report said.  World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels  in 1986/87 the report said as higher per capita incomes  increased domestic production and low import prices have  allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse  grains.  China India and South Korea have increased output while  the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the  mid-1970s the report said.    26\n",

      " GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH  A study on grain certificates due out  shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show  that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than  cash outlays administration and industry sources said.  Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture  Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests  that certificates cost more than cash payments a GAO official  told Reuters.  GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific  request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) former chairman of the  senate agriculture committee.  The report which will focus on the cost of certificates  compared to cash is scheduled to be released in mid March.  The cost of certificates said the GAO source depends on  the program s impact on the USDA loan program.  If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan  entries or cause more loan forfeitures then the net cost of  the program would go up. However if it is determined that  certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to  decrease the cost effect of certificates would be less.  GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates  program should be slowed or expanded the GAO official said.  But a negative report on certificates will fuel the fire  against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase  in the certificate program an agricultural consultant said.  The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program  while USDA remains firmly committed to it.    27\n",

      " U.S. CORN SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS  Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S.  corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in  deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates  and 50 pct in cash the U.S. Agriculture Department said.  It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and  sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.  Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to  the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman  budget deficit control act of 1985 it said.  Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency  payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225  mln dlrs respectively USDA said.  The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents  per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were  received by producers requesting advance payments.  Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference  between an established target price and the higher of the basic  loan rate or the national average price received by farmers  during the first five months of the marketing year --  September-January.  National weighted average market prices for the first five  months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and  1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will  be paid 63 cts per bushel based on the difference between the  3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.  Sorghum producers deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents  per bushel based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per  bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan  rate.  The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the  maximum permitted by law the department said.  Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another  1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average  market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing  year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates the  department said.  The payments will be issued through local Agricultural  Stabilization and Conservation Service offices it said.    27\n",

In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains the  department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has  reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels  insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at  around 98 dlrs per tonne.  For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5  mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the  breakeven export price it said.  Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance  payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price GMP calculated  at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current  year and the two lowest of the previous three years the  department said.  In addition deductions for taxes freight handling and  storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.  But the department said the Australian Bureau of  Agricultural Economics BAE predicts wheat production will  drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in  1989/90.  The decline will result from low world grain prices leading  to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S.  wheat exports the department said.    28\n",

      " CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS  Chicago Board of trade grain traders and  analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to  handle their upcoming spring plantings prompting sales of new  crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans  in the futures markets.  Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will  be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because  corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives  deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.  Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they  sign-up for reduced acreage but they have no price guarantees.  With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal  traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing  rather than gamble on soybeans even though the new crop  soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more  attractive under normal circumstances.  An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the  limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop  means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln  more oat acres this year than last without being penalized  traders said.  Here too acres some farmers may have been thinking of  shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats due to the  more attractive deal from the government they added.  Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six  months ago which should prompt many farmers in the South to  put soybean land back into cotton.  One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean  production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in  traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans  which are easier to grow one commercial trader said.    28\n",

They said last week s cereals management committee agreed  to release 70 000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders  between April 14 and May 26. It also indicated it planned to  allow the release of another 30 000 tonnes from April 23.  However it decided to leave consideration of the release  of further wheat until later.  The British government had applied for the release of a  further 100 000 tonnes in both May and June from British  intervention stores to prevent market prices rising.  However the sources said the Commission wanted to review  the market situation nearer the time before giving its  approval.  The Commission was given new powers last year to control  the release of intervention cereals onto the market the  sources noted.  Following last week s committee meeting the U.K. Ministry  of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that  additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made  available in May and June. It also said that it was envisaged  that monthly releases would be at least 100 000 tonnes  depending on the state of the market.  This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission  had actually approved the release of 300 000 tonnes during the  three months of April May and June at last week s meeting.    29\n",

Without the use of certificates Amstutz said nearly the  entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been  forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation CCC.  In addition 260 mln bushels of grain that have been  redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would  have remained in the goverment inventory he said.  When asked to comment on a recent study by the General  Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net  cost to the government Amstutz said GAO underestimated the  benefits and overstated the costs of the certificate program.  Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan  entries they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather  than forfeitures.  GAO underestimated this net loan activity Amstutz said.  There is no question in the mind of the Department of  Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful  Amstutz said.  Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market  liquidity improved market price competitiveness higher farm  income and improved debt situation and decreased carrying  costs he said.  Certificates are an integral part of USDA s long-range  market-oriented farm policy he said.  Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman  D-Kans. that USDA is in the process of preparing an official  response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to  the subcommittee when completed.    29\n",

      " MORE U.S. GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED STUDY SAYS  More generic grain certificates  should be released onto the market in order for the U.S.  certificate program to have its full effect on commodities  according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc.  The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency  payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third  certificate one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989  Carroll Brunthaver president of Sparks Commodities told a  House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates.  Thereafter government payments should be issued in roughly  a 50-50 split between cash and certificates Brunthaver said.  The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible  scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a zero  certificate case where no certificate program was assumed  and an alternative case labeled adequate certificate case in  which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain  prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages  due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings.  The study showed that total grain use under the adequate  certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario  by 11.2 pct.  Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990 when grain  usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the  zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct.  For the five-year period examined government expenditures  under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs or  7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case.  The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs or 70 pct of  those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs.  The study also estimated that government grain stocks under  the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels  below the zero certificate case at the end of the period  examined.  The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market  prices to fall below loan levels these lower prices increase  commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus  cash.    29\n",

      " EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE  The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of  social and structural measures agreed early today by European  Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers  for reducing output of certain surplus products EC Commission  sources said.  The ministers agreed that under this extensification  scheme farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut  output of specific products by at least 20 pct.  The plan would initially apply to cereals beef veal and  wine they added.  Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by  reducing acreage while cattle farmers would reduce their  number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case  farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity  for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.  The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but  will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on  the production they forego.  The sources said the package also contains provisions for  payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting  or improving the environment.  It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured  farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such  allowances are available only for livestock.  The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into  alternative farming techniques the sources added.  At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen  said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the  EC and member states to provide direct income supports for  relatively poor farmers.  Andriessen did not give full details but said member state  aid would be subject to strict criteria to avoid distortion of  competition.  EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a  difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus  production.  The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night  proposals to pay early retirement pensions to farmers aged 55  or over who gave up production. Those who took their land  completely out of farm production rather than passing it on to  their heirs would have received more generous payments.  Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised  proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme  agreed.    30\n",

      " TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST  Torrential rains throughout  Argentina s grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse  grain harvesting in the week to yesterday trade sources said.  Sunflower maize and sorghum harvests were particularly  affected they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to  soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or  May.  The rains did no damage to maize sunflower and sorghum  crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields  and cut the total volume of this year s harvest.  Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires  with the heaviest rains in the province s western sectors  between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa 10  and 75 mm in Santa Fe 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios five and 40  mm in Misiones and five and 50 mm in San Luis.  No rain was recorded in Corrientes Chaco and Formosa.  Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of  the coarse grain harvest over last week s estimates.  Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa  Fe though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of  total planted area compared to five to seven pct last week.  Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was  estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares or two to  seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the  1985/86 harvest.  Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11  mln tonnes or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6  mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates  or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year s volume according to  official figures.  The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine  pct of total planted area.  Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers  for this harvest down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year s figure  of 3.14 mln hectares.  Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln  and 2.7 mln tonnes which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and  41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the  1985/86 harvest.  Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and  four pct of total planted area which this harvest is 1.23 to  1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln  hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.  Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and  3.5 mln tonnes or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2  million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.  Soybean production by contrast is expected to hit a  record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes which would mean an increase of  11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year s record figure of 7.2 to 7.3  mln tonnes according to private estimates. Official figures  put last year s soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.  Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good  condition helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.  Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is  expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares up 10.8 to  13.8 pct from last year s harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.    30\n",

Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that  applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was  supported by the Reagan administration and would save  approximately 500 mln dlrs including 266 mln dlrs in corn  payments 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.

Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S.  Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency  payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not  to plant under the decoupling scheme.  If payments are not set in advance under decoupling market  prices conceivably could rise thereby leading to diminished  deficiency payments.

      " CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES  The Canadian Wheat Board has advised  the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to  farmers for their wheat oats and barley in the crop year  beginning August 1 a board spokesman said.  The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended  price drops but said it would not be good news for western  Canadian grain growers.  They re all lower he said. This is really getting  pretty serious. We re talking nuts and bolts economic survival  and whether it s worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop.  Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will  recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.  Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is  delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.  If the wheat board which markets most of Canada s grain  obtains higher than expected prices on world markets the  farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If  prices are lower the federal treasury makes up the difference.  The final decision on the initial prices usually made in  April rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the  federal cabinet.  Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27  pct but last fall the government announced a one billion  Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.

The current trade imbalance between the United States and  the Soviet Union high U.S. commodity prices and increased  world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement  next year less certain Albert Melnikov deputy trade  representative of the Soviet Union said in an interview.

Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have  indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as  attractive for both sides as it once was.  We have had one agreement.

How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement  if the United States does not want to offer us grain at  competitive prices? said Albert Melnikov deputy trade  representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.  We are in the market for grains but it is up to the  United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive  prices he said in an interview.  Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the  agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at  prevailing market prices.  We are being accused of not implementing this agreement.  We do not consider we are at fault Melnikov said.  Article I in the agreement states that purchases/sales of  commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market  price prevailing for these products at the time of  purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms.  The United States should supply to the Soviet Union  definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the  United States ready to supply this? he said.  The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has  been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn which he  confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes but said that if U.S. corn prices  remain competitive the Soviets will buy more if they need it.  Wheat buying however is a different story Melnikov said.  If the United States is interested in selling its wheat  then they must offer competitive prices and it s up to the  United States to decide how these competitive prices will be  offered he said.  Last year s U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets  was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy Melnikov said.  He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer  U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.    31\n",

      " U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT  The U.S. Agriculture Department is not  actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet  Union under the export enhancement program (EEP) senior USDA  officials said.  However grain trade analysts said the proposal has not  been ruled out and that an offer might be made though not in  the very near future.  The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again  an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. But there  just isn t much talk about it informally or formally.  Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident  than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the  Soviets even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer  when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier  this week.  But administration and private sources agreed that if the  Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to  Moscow it could take several months.  I just don t see any proposal like that sailing through any  interagency process the aide to Lyng said.  An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight  said one former USDA official who noted that the  administration took three months to decide in favor of selling  China wheat under the subsidy program.  An official representing a large grain trade company said  deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of  Congress a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat  subsidy offer to the Soviets.  But Lyng s aide said that during a day-long visit to  Capitol Hill yesterday House members did not press the  secretary on the subsidy question a single time.  The administration s interagency trade policy review group  comprised of subcabinet-level officials has not been asked to  clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP officials  at the U.S. Trade Representative s Office said.  In their talks this week the two sides discussed the  administration s previous EEP offer but did not talk about any  new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the  consultations this week described them as an exchange of calm  basic factual economics.  Another USDA official said there was not even an informal  suggestion or hint that the Soviets would live up to their  pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were  granted more favorable terms.  USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an  EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be  delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming  from the Iran arms affair.    31\n",

      " INDONESIAN AGRICULTURE GROWTH EXPECTED TO SLOW  Indonesia s agriculture sector will grow  by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987 against an estimated 2.4 pct  in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or  declines the U.S. Embassy said in a report.  Production of Indonesia s staple food rice is forecast to  fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of  26.58 mln tonnes in 1986 according to the annual report on  Indonesia s agricultural performance.  The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at  26.7 mln tonnes with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987  The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln  tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of  a drawdown on stocks.  Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look  promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the  production of sugarcane rubber and copra show little or no  gain the report says.  The modest overall increase which is expected will be due  to significant gains in production of corn soybeans palm oil  and palm kernels.  Constraints to significant overall increases in  agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant  seeds limited fertile land insect pests and a reluctance by  farmers to shift from rice production to other crops the  report underlines.  The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of  pests known as wereng or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which  largely offset gains in yields.  The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57  insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now  resistant to these varieties and to use lower-yielding more  resistant rice types.  The government is depending on increased production of  export commodities such as coffee tea rubber plywood and  palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude  oil prices.  Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct  in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln with exports rising  to an estimated 720 000 tonnes from 695 000 tonnes in 1986 the  report says.  But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will  rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980 000 in 1986/87 imports will  also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.  The report says that imports of wheat soybeans soybean  meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last  September s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise  in domestic demand.  The report said that Indonesia s overall economic  performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight  negative growth rate the lowest rate of growth since the  mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct  in 1984.  The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible  for the slump.    346 HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE  A House Agriculture Committee meeting  later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a  debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92 or  de-coupling provision to cover feedgrains and those who  oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited Congressional sources  said.  The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year  0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter  wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and  still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.  The administration has strongly urged that the bill be  expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.  It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision  will emerge from the committee the sources said.  Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large  estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates  by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.  Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this  time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of  the bill committee staffers said.  The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A  conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting and  staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.  Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an  expanded 0/92 program since spring planting in many areas of  the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup  for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.  Farmers are now making their planting decisions so  something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be  implemented an Agriculture Department source said.  An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last  week s subcommittee hearing on the bill with subcommittee  chairman Dan Glickman D-Kan. saying that more study of the  consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was  necessary.  Major commodity groups including the National Corn  Growers the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen s  Association have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.  But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill  currently is not equitable for all grains producers so it  should be extended to other crops.  There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat said  Gene Moos aide to house majority leader Tom Foley D-Wash.  Projected cost savings in the current atmosphere of try to  decrease farm expenditures would also be hard to ignore in the  debate to expand the 0/92 application Moos said.  Rep. Charles Stenholm D-Tex. may be planning to introduce  a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat with the  argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major  changes in the farm bill.  Stenholm s bill is not a rejection of 0/92 only of the  timing a congressional staff member said.  Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an  amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988  feedgrains.    34\n",

In comments on its Export Sales Report the department said  sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported  under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for  delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR  Grains Supply Agreement which began October 1.  Japan added 689 700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales  to unknown destinations rose by 429 800 tonnes.  Wheat sales of 362 400 tonnes for the current season and 151 000 for the 1987/88 season were down by more than half from  the previous week s combined sales it said.  Egypt Japan and Iraq were the major wheat buyers for  delivery in the current year while sales to China decreased by 30 000 tonnes for the current season but increased by 90 0  tonnes for the 1987/88 season which begins June 1.  Net sales of soybeans totalling 274 200 tonnes equaled the  preceding week but were nearly a third below the four week  average. Major increases were for Belgium South Korea Mexico  and Italy it said.  Soybean cake and meal sales of 103 700 tonnes were 2-3/4  times the previous week s marketing year low but six pct less  than the four week average.  Major increases for West Germany Belgium Spain Italy and  Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown  destinations.  Soybean oil sales of 5 400 tonnes were the result of  increases for Venezuela and reductions of 500 tonnes for  unknown destinations.  Combined sales activity in cotton of 75 200 running bales  -- 44 700 bales for the current year and 30 500 bales for the  1987/88 bales -- were 56 pct below the prior week s good  showing the department said.

      " HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT  Key members of the House Agriculture  committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a  pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat but a  broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later  Congressional sources said.  The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn  English (D-Okla.) and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support  an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm  (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop  winter and spring wheat.  This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original  proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987  wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the  subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.  Under 0/92 a farmer can forego planting a crop but still  collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.  Earlier today the House Agriculture committee postponed  until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill  and 0/92.  The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program  follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential  farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92  and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.  Congressional sources said there has not been enough time  to study the implications of a broad 0/92.  The timing (of the proposal) is off said one aide to a  House Agriculture committee member.  However several Congressional sources said they expect a  broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House  Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make  spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part  of an overall deficit reduction package.  Gene Moos aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley  (D-Wash.) predicted agriculture s share of budget cuts may  exceed one billion dlrs.  A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the  Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration  estimate it would result in significant budget savings.  A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all  1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5  billion dlrs over five years.  Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the  approach of planting season Congressional sources said.  Some officials said it already is late for implementation  of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for  wheat and feedgrains.  If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either  would have to be extended or reopened sources said.    35\n",

Pat Henderson spokesperson for the MGE said the exchange  expects contract approval at CFTC s Tuesday meeting. It has  been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in  December 1985  The proposed contract is based on 48 000 pound lots of  55-pct high fructose corn syrup the equivalent of one tank  truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet  milling process. The syrup commonly called HFCS-55 is most  commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other  beverages.  Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production  facilities designated by the exchange. The contract designated  by the symbol HF would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months  traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of  March May July September and December.  Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight with a  minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation  of one dlr per CWT.  We hope the producers and users of fructose will be  actively involved those producers being the large processors  the corn wet millers and the users being the beverage  bottlers Henderson said.

The disaster aid bill introduced by Rep. Glenn English  (D-Okla.) sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to  implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.  An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987  wheat but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that  scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.  Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat  it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should  be treated equally they said.  If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat then  supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not  offer their proposals next week sources said.  English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles  Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only but  whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.  Agricultural aides to English said the congressman s first  choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat  farmers. However if the political reality is that disaster aid  for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of  controversy over spring wheat then English might consider an  even greater cutback in the bill they said.  Under a 0/92 plan farmers could forego planting and still  receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.  Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.)  have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to  include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.  An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm  bill but to be fair to all crops.  Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would  likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are  greater than to idle the land economists said.  Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is  premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the  House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the  impacts of such a program.    36\n",

The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and  just change corn to corn gluten feed in their complaint Hall  told Reuters.  A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm  policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and  supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85  cts per bushel.  This was cleary a political decision Hall said. The  amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant.  The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument  that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and  that American farm policy has driven down these prices thus  causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government  payments through its farm stabilization program Hall said.  Hall said this is a new definition for injury but that  other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack  U.S. farm programs.  The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm  programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed Hall  said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of  U.S. corn gluten feed into the community saying that the  imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.    36\n",

      " FINAL 50/50 CORN CERTS SEEN AT 1.6 BILLION DLRS  The Agriculture Department will have  to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind  certificates or certs to corn farmers this fall if USDA  decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain  deficiency payments in cash and certs USDA officials said.  Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to  feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for  the 1986 crop now complete were made in a 50/50  cash-certificate split and USDA officials have indicated they  want to do the same for feedgrains.  Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn  deficiency payments have already been announced with 1.42  billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment  must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.  However the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of  deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs  doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.  Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation  from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge  release of certs onto the market.  Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final  feedgrain deficiency payment to as soon as five months after  harvest as possible rather than the current year lag time.  Neither Rep. Edward Madigan (R-Ill.) nor Sen. Bob Dole  (R-Kans.) sponsors of the bills have brought the legislation  forward. Aides said timing will depend on budget discussions.    38\n",

In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook USDA said  the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the  U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and  coarse grain from other major suppliers.  USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes up one  mln from last month s estimate and 700 000 tonnes below the  preliminary 1985/86 figure.  Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln  tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories along with  a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage and a  cold winter have increased feed demand USDA said.  USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly  from the previous January s level while milk production  increased by nearly six pct.  Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in  roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock  production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier  USDA said.    38\n",

      " CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION  Chicago Board of Trade (CBT)  agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a  period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes  ahead with planned renovation.  A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a  number of options to identify the most cost effective and  efficient way to proceed including one which would involve  moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the  nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.  One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann s agenda items has  been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room  the spokesman said.  Another CBT official executive vice president George  Sladoje said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a  special meeting on the exchange floor.  A number of presentations have been made with regard to  renovating the financial futures room Sladoje said. We ve  looked at five or six different alternatives involving such  things as flip-flopping the trading rooms he added.  It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans we  might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT  markets Sladoje said.  If we move out of one floor entirely then the  construction period will be about a year he said adding that  the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then  be on the drawing board for eight months to a year.  The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very  preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until  this summer at the earliest.  In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits  exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary  home next door in the present grains-dominated area.  This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond  futures Treasury Notes Muni-bonds and options on T-Bonds and  T-Notes through an adjoining corridor while utilizing the  MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn wheat  soybeans soybean products and agricultural options.  Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT  members.  One senior floor trader said the financial futures room  badly needs renovating.  There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and  the financials will move to the grains area he said.  The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was  to renovate the financial floor in quadrants one quarter at a  time. The first step after deciding the most effective way to  proceed would be to get architectural and engineering  drawings he said.  He added that it was difficult at present to determine an  exact time frame for any possible moves. This is a major  undertaking and a process that would spread out over next  year he said.  Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange which  merged with the CBT about a year ago said they were preparing  to vacate their floor at the end of this month.  Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by  moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved  for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures which now share  their trading area.  The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains  livestock metals financials and foreign currencies as well as  some options contracts.  Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here  because the bonds are too crowded one MidAm trader said.  Another source at the MidAm said this change could take  place by July or August.    39\n",

They said the market already has discounted higher Soviet  imports partly on news last month that the Soviet Union bought  one mln tonnes of U.S. corn and on rumors that the Reagan  administration is pushing for authority to sell the Soviets  U.S. wheat under the Export Enhancement Program.  In its supply-demand report the USDA raised its estimate  for 1986/87 Soviet grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from 23 mln.

      " USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT  The Soviet Union will likely honor  its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four  mln tonnes of corn this year an Agriculture Department  official said.  They have always honoured the agreement and there s no  reason now to think they won t this year he told Reuters.  They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European  Community from Canada from the U.S. They re active buyers  from all sources at this point the official said in  explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports  estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.  This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when  analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for  the first time in 15 years.  A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina concern  over Soviet winter crops and increasing competition for U.S.  corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow s  recent interest.  Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying  countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan  and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation the  official said.  The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists  and buy corn before prices get too high the official said. As  soon as they need corn they ll buy it he added.  USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the  Soviet Union but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the  purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.  The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets  would enter the U.S. market again.  There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the  situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of  frenetic buying now the official said.  However the situation in wheat is a different story he  said. Greater world supplies of wheat heavier Soviet purchase  commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet  purchases of U.S. wheat less likely he said.  Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S.  is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to  the Soviets but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.    39\n",

Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he  thought the proposal supported by the Reagan administration  should be seriously considered because a refusal to do so could  play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls placed  on production.  However Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92  option which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their  income support payments regardless of how much they planted.  The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two  problems. First it is viewed he said by some as welfare. In  addition debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm  bill Dole said.  Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export  enhancement program saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union  could help improve U.S. relations with that country.  Dole said that the United States has made the decision to  trade with Moscow and that it s important to offer competitive  prices.  The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this  year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy  program which currently targets benefits to recapture markets  lost to other suppliers which subsidize.  Dole who last year pledged to offer legislation to require  a marketing loan for major crops but never did so again called  for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.  The Reagan administration s proposed farm policy changes  are not going anywhere this year Dole said singling out the  proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.  Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a  shift in the State Department towards supporting an export  enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union Dole said he  didn t see any change.  Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate  whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.

      " MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS  Heavy rains fell again in  Argentina s main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday  trade sources said.  Rains fell heaviest early in the week and in particularly  high volume in Buenos Aires province Cordoba La Pampa and  Santa Fe provinces.  Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires  heaviest in western sectors of the province 20 to 145 mm in La  Pampa 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe.  Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.  Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes five to  31 mm in San Luis five to 30 mm in Entre Rios three to 20 mm  in Misiones 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in  Chaco.  Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the  rains had damaged crops though they said maize and sunflower  crops may have suffered.  Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by  the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal the rains  would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow  farm machinery to operate.  The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern  Buenos Aires as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas  there since February 23 while the annual average is 1 200 mm.  Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares  Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after  flying over the flooded area.  Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500 0  hectares of the area now flooded had been planted and that 200 000 to 300 000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large  parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are  low-lying and flood easily.  Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the  heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of  the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high  winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.  The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south  of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated  areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between  15 and 18 pct of total planted area up from seven to nine pct  a week ago.  Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were  revised downward in light of the bad weather.  Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes  down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down  34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year s record harvest of 4.1 mln  tonnes.  Maize harvesting also advanced reaching between 13 and 15  pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week  ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2  mln tonnes down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a  week ago.  Last year s maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes  according to official figures.  Soybean production estimates were revised downward to 7.8  to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln  tonnes a week ago. Last year s soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln  tonnes according to official figures.  Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward reaching between  four and six pct of total planted area compared to two to four  pct a week ago.  Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5  mln tonnes down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes  produced in the last harvest.    40\n",

      " AWB SAYS AUSTRALIAN WHEAT SALES OVER 10 MLN TONNES  The Australian Wheat Board s (AWB)  1986/87 export program is well advanced with over 10 mln tonnes  already sold AWB general manager Ron Paice said.  We are certainly within reach of our 15 mln tonne export  target for the year he said in a statement.  He did not detail the commitments already made but an AWB  spokesman said they include sales to Egypt China Iran the  Soviet Union and Iraq.  In the 1985/86 wheat year ended September 30 the AWB  exported a record 15.96 mln tonnes.  Paice also said the 1986/87 Australian wheat harvest has  ended after a long cool summer with 15.14 mln tonnes delivered  to the AWB.  The season produced another good crop with only 0.2 pct of  receivals being downgraded to feed quality he said.  However it is likely that some weather-damaged grain was  still being held on farms and further milling and feed wheat  may be delivered following the recent announcement of the final  Guaranteed Minimum Price for 1986/87 he said.  Paice did not give a crop estimate but the AWB s February  Wheat Australia publication put the crop at 16.7 mln tonnes.  But the AWB spokesman said it is likely this estimate could  turn out to be too high based on the receivals level and the  final crop figure would probably be nearer to 16.2 mln tonnes.  The official estimate is not yet available.  In the 1985/86 season the AWB received 15.08 mln tonnes of  the 16.13 mln tonne crop.  Another 422 000 tonnes was retained on-farm and 620 0  sold under the permit system introduced in 1984/85 to allow  farmers to sell feed wheat to the grain trade outside the AWB s  receival system according to Bureau of Agricultural Economics  data.    41\n",

      " PORTUGAL GRAIN AGENCY BARRED FROM IMPORT TENDERS  A Portuguese court has made a  preliminary ruling that the state grain buying agency EPAC  should not be allowed to take part in public import tenders  open to private importers grain traders and officials said.  Under the terms of Portugal s January 1986 accession to the  European Community EC a grain import monopoly held by EPAC  (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced  by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.  Private traders protested last year that EPAC was being  permitted to take part in tenders open to them for the first  liberalised 20 pct share of the country s annual import needs.  The grain and oilseed importers association ACICO opened legal  proceedings to stop EPAC participating in the public tenders.  Miguel Ascensao of ACICO told Reuters that Lisbon s civil  court in a preliminary ruling had decided EPAC should not be  allowed to take part in tenders open to private traders.  Trade sources said the ruling though effective  immediately was subject to appeal and would have to be  confirmed in further proceedings.  A member of the government Cereals Market Commission said  that as a result of the court s decision the Commission would  not be able to accept offers from EPAC in a public tender being  held today for the import of 80 000 tonnes of corn.  Ascensao said the court ruling stated that EPAC s  participation in the public tenders violated the clauses of  Portugal s EC accession treaty dealing with the gradual  dismantling of the state agency s import monopoly.  It also said the participation of EPAC which still  controls the national grain storage and distribution network  was unfair competition to the private traders.  Traders said they believed the EC s Executive Commission  was unlikely to get involved in the dispute preferring to  leave the case to be resolved as an internal Portuguese issue.  They (the EC Commission) will be keeping a low profile one  trader said.  ACICO says it is ready to take its case to Brussels if  necessary.    41\n",

Lyng who plans to be in Japan April 14-27 said he will  not ask Tokyo to liberalize fully its rice market. We will urge  that they consider sharing their rice market he said.  The USDA secretary would not say how big a share of the  Japanese rice market the U.S. would request. We ve got none of  it now. If we got one per cent of it it would be a big  improvement he said.  Last year the Reagan administration rejected a petition by  the U.S. rice industry seeking relief from Japanese import  restrictions.  However the U.S. said it would reexamine the issue if by  mid-1987 Japan did not roll back import barriers to U.S. rice  exports.  Lyng said he would not be conducting formal negotiations  next month with Japan over their beef and citrus quotas but  that his visit may be a forerunner in a general way to talks  prior to expiration of the bilateral agreement in March 1988.

It hasn t been worth much in the last two years....They  haven t lived up to the agreement as I see it Lyng said in an  interview with Reuters.  It would be my thought that it s not worth any effort to  work out an agreement with someone who wants the agreement to  be a one-sided thing he said.  However Lyng said he did not want to make a definitive  commitment one way or another at this point.  Under the accord covering 1983-88 the Soviets agreed to  buy at least nine mln tonnes of U.S. grain including four mln  tonnes each of corn and wheat.  Moscow bought 6.8 mln tonnes of corn and 153 000 tonnes of  wheat during the third agreement year which ended last  September and this year has bought one mln tonnes of corn.  Lyng said he had no knowledge of how much U.S. grain Moscow  would buy this year.  I ve seen people making comments on that and I don t know  how they know unless they talk to the Soviets he said. I have  no knowledge and I really don t think anyone other than the  Soviets have any knowledge.

      " GLICKMAN PUSHES HARD FOR 0/92 FARM PLAN  Implementation of a one-year 0/92  pilot program for wheat and feedgrains was strongly promoted  today by the chairman of a key house agriculture subcommittee  as a way to cut farm costs and simultaneously give farmers  another option when making their planting decisions.  We have a budget driven farm policy. It may be a shame  but we are locked into this said Dan Glickman (D-Kans.)  chairman of the subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feed  grains. We need to look at ways to cut costs and not hurt the  farmer. A 0/92 plan if properly done could do both.  Glickman announced this week plans to introduce a 0/92 bill  for 1987 and 1988 wheat and feedgrains. An aide to Glickman  said that it will probably be introduced next week.  Glickman said a 0/92 program which allows a farmer to  forego planting and still receive 92 pct of his deficiency  payment would not be a major revision of the 1985 farm bill --  only an extension of the 50/92 option already provided under  the current bill.  It is premature to make any major changes in the farm bill  he said but if agriculture has to make further cuts to meet  budget goals a voluntary 0/92 plan would be better than  sharply cutting target prices as USDA has proposed.  A 0/92 plan however would not be decoupling but simply a  different type of acreage diversion program Glickman said.  Decoupling -- delinking planting decisions from government  payments -- is too much of a policy change to approve at this  point he said.  I don t think there is any interest in pursuing a  decoupling bill this year. Period. Unequivocal Glickman said  at the hearing.  Sen. Rudy Boschwitz (R-Minn.) cosponsor of the  Boren/Boschwitz decoupling plan said he supports a short term  0/92 program as a move to a more permament decoupling plan.  Boschwitz plans to introduce a 0/92 plan in the senate. His  plan would guarantee a certain deficiency payment to  participating farmers require that idled acreage be put to  conservation use only prohibit haying and grazing on extra  idled acreage limit participation to a certain number of acres  in a county and provide tenant protection provisions.  I know we cannot obtain complete decoupling in 1987 but  we can at least move in that direction Boschwitz said.  Robbin Johnson vice president of Cargill Inc. testified  in favor of decoupling. Decoupling would end the current bias  in U.S. farm policy towards overproduction and reduce farmers  dependency on the government he said.  A 0/92 plan does not go far enough in decoupling Johnson  said and would still encourage farmers to plant.  Officials from the National Corn Growers Association and  the National Cattlemen s Association said their groups oppose  any 0/92 or decoupling plan due to concerns about reopening the  farm bill and creating more confusion among farmers.  But when asked if his association were forced to choose  between a ten pct cut in target prices or a 0/92 program Larry  Johnson of the Corn Growers said they would agree to 0/92  rather than take sharp cuts in target levels.    42\n",

Testifying before the House Agriculture subcommittee on  wheat soybeans and feedgrains Robbin Johnson vice president  of Cargill Inc. disputed claims that U.S. grain companies  have made huge profits from certificate trading.  The certs program is not in any way a windfall to the  trade he said. Johnson said that Cargill has been dealing  with a two pct spread in certificate transactions and that  this is within the normal grain marketing levels.  Johnson recognized current concern over the cost of  certificates as compared to cash but said that critics need to  look more closely at the savings caused by certs noting for  example that widespread use of certs in the PIK and Roll  marketing technique last summer helped ease storage costs.  Certificates are also an important part of any export  promotion program he said.  The more you look at ways to expand export markets the  more you have to look at ways to expand certs to put more grain  into the market to meet demand he said.

Approximately 1.5 mln tonnes of Yugoslav corn have already  been committed to foreign buyers for 1986/87 with most of this  sold to the Soviet Union the Yugoslav Grain Association  reported to the U.S. official.  In a report dated March 10 the official said that about 800 000 tonnes of the corn has been delivered with the balance  of 700 000 tonnes to be shipped between now and June.  An additional 500 000 tonnes of corn can be shipped from  July-September the grain associaiton said so total Yugoslav  corn exports could reach 2.0 mln tonnes the counselor said.  Heavier than normal monthly shipping rates for Yugoslav  corn exports are due to the increased use of river barges for  exporting corn to the Soviet Union the counselor said.  Monthly corn shipments out of Yugoslavia have averaged  around 160 000 tonnes since October 1 higher than earlier  estimates of 150 0 the official said.  The Soviet Union has taken an increased share of Yugoslav  corn sales during this marketing year he said.    43\n",

      " NUMEROUS FACTORS SAID POINT TO USSR CORN BUYING  A greater than anticipated need  competitive prices and political motivations could be sparking  Soviet interest in U.S. corn industry and government officials  said.  As rumors circulated through grain markets today that the  Soviet Union has purchased an additional 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S.  corn industry and government sources noted a number of factors  that make Soviet buying of U.S. corn likely.  First there are supply concerns. Some trade sources said  recent speculation has been that last year s Soviet grain crop  be revised to only 190 mln tonnes rather than the 210 mln  announced therby increasing the Soviet need for grain.  A drop in Argentine corn crop prospects could also affect  Soviet corn buying an Agriculture Department source said.  Dry weather in Argentina -- a major corn supplier to the  USSR -- and reported crop problems prompted USDA to lower its  Argentine 1986/87 corn crop estimate this week to 11.0 mln  tonnes down from 11.5 mln. Argentina corn exports were also  cut by 500 000 tonnes to 6.8 mln tonnes.  Argentina has already committed four mln tonnes of this  year s corn for export a USDA official said with two mln  tonnes of that booked for April-June delivery to the USSR.  Significant downside potential still exists for the  Argentine crop the official said which will decrease the  amount of additional corn that country can sell to Moscow.  If the Soviet needs are greater than we have been  thinking then they might need more than what Argentina can  provide during the April to June period he said.  Current competitive prices for U.S. corn have also sparked  Soviet buying.  U.S. corn was reported to be selling on the world market  earlier this week for around 71 dlrs per tonne Argentine corn  for 67 dlrs -- a very competitive price spread U.S. and Soviet  sources said.  This price difference makes American corn competitive  Albert Melnikov commercial counselor for the Soviet Union  told Reuters.  Impending crop problems in Argentina will likely cause  those prices to rise and with the recently strong U.S. corn  futures prices the Soviets might feel corn prices have  bottomed and that this is a good time to buy sources said.  Finally some industry sources said that by buying the  minimum amount of corn guaranteed under the U.S./USSR grains  agreement (four mln tonnes) the Soviet Union may be hoping to  convince the USDA to offer Moscow a subsidy on wheat.  In an inteview with Reuters this week USDA secretary  Richard Lyng said that no decision had been made on a wheat  subsidy offer but that such an offer had not been ruled out.    43\n",

      " U.S. CONSERVATION FIGURES SEEN NEUTRAL/BEARISH  U.S. Agriculture Department (USDA)  figures for highly-erodible land enrolled into the Conservation  Reserve Program were regarded by most grain analysts as neutral  to bearish although some said a full state-by-state breakdown  would be needed to assess the full price impact.  Out of 10.5 mln acres only 1.9 mln acres were accepted in  corn -- That s neutral at best and perhaps bearish to what the  trade was looking for Dale Gustafson of Drexel Burnham  Lambert said.  The USDA said it had accepted 10 572 402 more acres into  the conservation program out of bids on a total of 11 254 837  acres.  Gustafson said he would not be changing his estimate of  planted acreage for corn as a result of the latest figures but  some other analysts said they would adjust their estimates  slightly. The USDA is due to release planting intentions  figures March 31.  Indications of a heavy sign-up in the conservation program  recently lowered most trade estimates of corn planted acreage  to 63.0 to 67.0 mln acres from 67.0 to 69.0 mln.  Richard Loewy analyst with Prudential Bache Securities  said there was not enough information to completely assess the  conservation figures. The 1.9 mln acres on corn is certainly  disappointing he added.  The USDA later released the state-by-state breakdown of the  enrollment figures.  Loewy said the initial figures appeared to be negative for  both new crop corn and soybeans and might possibly mean an  upward adjustment in planting intention figures.  Asked about the impact on the flow of generic certificates  onto the market this spring he said: The trade was definitely  looking higher so certificates are going to be less than  expected.  The USDA offered a special corn bonus rental payment to  the farmers to be paid in generic certificates. The bonus  amounts to two dlrs per bushel based on the farm program  payment yield for corn for each acre of corn accepted into the  reserve.  Katharina Zimmer analyst for Merrill Lynch Futures said  the conservation sign-up was slightly higher than she had  expected although she noted that some trade expectations were  considerably higher than the actual figures.  I think it is friendly for the market at least in the  long run she said.  Susan Hackmann of AgriAnalysis said there was some  confusion over whether trade ideas of an enrollment figure  between 15 and 18 mln acres referred to the total sign-up or  the latest addition.  It seems the trade was looking for more acres to be bid  into the program she said.  Hackmann said she would not make much change to her ideas  about corn planting figures as a result of the conservation  sign-up. She added that while some trade guesses were as low as  61 mln acres she was looking for corn plantings to be in the  high 60 s.  Zimmer of Merrill Lynch said she would be making a slight  reduction of about one mln acres in her planting estimate to  around 64 mln acres.  New crop corn prices at the Chicago Board of Trade firmed  earlier this week on ideas of a large sign-up in the program  despite the fact that acres enrolled are generally poor  yielding and not likely to make a substantial difference to  final production figures.    44\n",

      " CANADA RULING ON U.S. CORN INJURY DUE THIS WEEK  The Canadian government is expected  to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn  exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers U.S.  government and farm group representatives said.  The deadline for a final determination is March 7.  U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a  similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case  Canada decided pasta imports which take about ten pct of the  Canadian market did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn  exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.  Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn  imports in November 1986 but reduced the duty to 85 cts last  month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.    44\n",

The Times of Zambia which is run by the ruling United  National Independence Party (UNIP) quoted official sources as  saying the IMF and World Bank had refused to continue financing  food subsidies and were pressing the government to explain how  it proposes to pay for them.  President Kenneth Kaunda tried to abolish maize subsidies  last December in line with IMF recommendations but the move  caused maize meal prices to double overnight and led to riots.  The subsidies were immediately restored as part of moves to  quell the disturbances.  The Times of Zambia said another major issue in the  government s current talks with the IMF and World Bank was the  remodelling of Zambia s foreign exchange auction.  The central bank s weekly auction of foreign exchange to  the private sector has been suspended since the end of January  pending modifications to slow down the rate of devaluation and  dampen fluctuations in the exchange rate.  The kwacha slid to around 15 per dollar under the auction  losing 85 pct of its value in 16 months but since the end of  January has been revalued to a fixed rate of nine per dollar.  Banking sources said Zambia was persuaded by the World Bank  and IMF to lift its proposed ceiling of 12.50 kwacha per dollar  on the currency s devaluation once the auctions restart.    44\n",

      " AROUND 3.5 MLN ACRES SAID TO BE IDLED BY 0/92  A 0/92 program would have very  little impact on U.S. acreage prompting farmers to idle only  an additional 3.5 mln acres of cropland every year according  to a report from the Agriculture Department.  The savings resulting from the additional 3.5 mln acres  idled would be a little over 400 mln dlrs in loan savings 35  mln dlrs in transportation and storage savings and 10-20 mln  dlrs per year in deficiency payment savings the report said.  The USDA report asssessed the impacts of the proposed 0/92  acreage program for wheat corn cotton sorghum and barley.  Last year almost 245 mln acres of those crops were harvested.  The likelihood that the 0-92 provisiion will cause very  large acreages to be removed from crop production is quite  small the report said.  The returns on typical farms still favor participation in  the usual acreage reduction programs and seeding the permitted  acreage the USDA report said.  The 0/92 program which would allow farmers to forego  planting and still receive 92 pct of their deficiency payment  would be most used by producers in high production/high risk  areas where cost of production is high said Keith Collins  director of USDA s economics analysis staff.  In the heart of the corn belt you would not get that much  participation Collins said.  USDA estimated that an additional one mln acres of wheat  would be ildled under 0/92 1.5 mln acres of corn 500 0  acres of sorghum and barley and 500 000 acres of cotton.  Production from these idled acres would be equivalent to 40  mln bushels of wheat 180 mln bushels of corn 20 mln bushels  of sorghum 10 mln bushels of barley and 500 000 bales of  cotton the report said.  In determining whether to participate a producer would  need to weigh the expected cash costs of production against the  loan rate ... The risk that market prices may rise above the  expected levels and reduce the deficiency payment also must be  considered according to the analysis.  What you re giving up under 0/92 is the difference between  the loan rate and the cost of production Collins said.  For producers with low production costs that difference is  greater and can be applied to paying variable costs he said.  Under these cicumstances farmers would not want to go along  with 0/92. But for high cost producers 0/92 would be more  attractive.  Also as loan rates get lower Collins said there would be  more incentives to participate in a 0/92 program.  I would admit that its impacts would be very marginal at  first but it is a step towards the goal of separating  production decisions from government payments Collins said.  In a speech earlier today before the National Grains and  Feed Association USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said it is too  late to implement 0/92 for 1987 crops since program signup will  be over by the end of this month.    45\n",

The department said the sales will be subsidized with  commodities from the Commodity Credit Corporation CCC  inventory and the subsidy will enable U.S. exports to compete  at commercial prices in the Algerian market.  Algeria has already purchased 300 000 tonnes of U.S. durum  wheat under a previous export enhancement initiative announced  November 10 1986 it said.  Details of the latest initiative including an invitation  for offers from exporters will be issued in the near future  the department said.    46\n",

      " CHINA TO IMPORT MORE GRAIN IN 1987  China s grain imports will rise  in 1987 because of a serious drought and increasing demand but  will be not be as large as in the past Chinese officials and  Japanese traders told Reuters.  They said foreign exchange constraints and national policy  would not allow a return to large-scale imports which peaked  at 16.15 mln tonnes in 1982.  An agricultural official of the Shanghai government put  maximum imports at about 10 mln tonnes this year against 7.73  mln in 1986 and 5.97 mln in 1985.  Officials said grain imports rose in 1986 because of a poor  harvest and rising domestic demand but remained below exports  which rose to 9.42 mln tonnes from 9.33 mln in 1985.  China is short of foreign exchange the Shanghai official  said. We cannot rely on imports even at current low world  prices. Only if there is a major disaster will we become a  major importer.  A Japanese trader in Peking said Chinese grain imports  would rise and exports fall this year because of the drought  low world prices and rising domestic demand for human and  animal consumption.  At current prices China loses yuan on every tonne of grain  it exports though it earns foreign exchange which it badly  needs the trader said.  The People s Daily said last Saturday a serious drought is  affecting 13.3 mln hectares of arable land which will reduce  the summer grain harvest from last year s level.  The paper added that leaders in some areas were not paying  enough attention to agriculture especially grain making it  difficult to achieve the 1987 grain output target of 405 mln  tonnes against 391 mln in 1986.  All areas must spare no effort to raise the autumn harvest  area especially of corn sweet potatoes paddy rice and  high-yield cash crops it said.  It added factory production might have to be reduced to  provide electricity for agriculture if it was needed to fight  the drought.  Since January the press has devoted much attention to  grain stressing that growth in output is vital to China s  economic and political stability and that prices paid to  farmers are too low.  Officials in east China have repeatedly said stable grain  production is a key state policy and outlined the measures  being taken in their areas to encourage output.  The Shanghai official said that in one suburb 10 pct of  the pre-tax profits of factories are used to subsidise  agriculture. He said rural industries in other suburbs also set  aside money for grain and pay the salaries of some of the 70 000 workers available to help farmers.  Chu Jinfeng an official of Fengbing county outside  Shanghai said factory workers get 60 yuan a month and three  years unpaid leave to grow grain and can keep the profits.  Pan Huashan an official of the agricultural department of  Zhejiang Province said rural industry also subsidises grain  output in his province.  In addition we are setting up grain production bases  raising the level of science and technology on the farms and  improving the supply of raw materials roads and other  infrastructure he said.  The Shanghai official said rural residents who work in  industry or commerce usually keep their land to farm in their  spare time or let other family members farm it. In some cases  they lease the land to grain farmers.  The China Daily said last month that grain output should  reach between 425 and 450 mln tonnes by 1990 and between 480  and 500 mln by 2000. It said growing grain should be made  profitable.  The advantages the state promises grain growers actually  yield tangible profits for them and are not siphoned off by  intermediate agencies because of bureaucracy or corruption.  Only this will boost enthusiasm it said.    46\n",

They said 1987 maize deliveries are expected to decline to  around 520 000 tonnes from 1.6 mln tonnes last year. About 60  pct of the maize will be delivered by large-scale commercial  farmers and the balance by small-scale peasant producers.  Although this will be the lowest level of maize deliveries  since 1980 the sources said there is no danger of a food  shortage in Zimbabwe.  While annual maize consumption is estimated at 750 0  tonnes the GMB stockpile is currently around 1.8 mln tonnes  which means that even with the sharply reduced production this  year Zimbabwe has enough maize for the next three years.  The sources said the lower maize crop would be offset by a  25 pct increase in cotton production to 315 000 tonnes from 248 000 tonnes last year and by a rise of 20 pct in soybean  deliveries to 100 000 tonnes from 84 000 tonnes in 1986.    46\n",

      " U.S. HOUSE TARGETING PROPOSAL SPARKS INTEREST  A proposal by two U.S. House  Democrats to target government farm benefits to small- and  medium-sized farms was warmly received by Democrats on a  House subcommittee today.  On balance this is the best new idea I have seen said  Rep. Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) Chairman of the House Agriculture  Subcommittee on Wheat Feedgrains and Soybeans. This is the  first hard constructive proposal coming out as an alternative  to the (Reagan) administration s farm proposal.  The plan offered by Reps. Tim Penny (D-Minn.) and Byron  Dorgan (D-ND) would raise target prices for wheat to 5.00 dlrs  per bushel and for corn to 3.50 dlrs. Producers could receive  deficiency payments on up to 80 pct of normal yield but not  more than on 30 000 bu of corn and 20 000 bu of wheat.  The proposal also would require acreage reductions of 20  pct eliminate generic certificates and prohibit persons not  actively engaged in farming from receiving program benefits.  Dorgan said the bill would save 24 billion dlrs over five  years protect family farms and eliminate government  accumulation of stocks because nonrecourse loans would be  halted.  However Rep. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.) said the measure would  involve the federal government in deciding and defining who a  family farmer is.  Roberts said the bill for example would restrict program  payments to 500 acres of wheat production in western Kansas.  Other Republicans on the panel questioned how the bill  would determine if a person was actively engaged in farming and  therefore eligible for payments.    47\n",

      " U.S. HOUSE APPROVES PILOT 0/92 DISASTER PROGRAM  The House of Representatives  approved a bill to enable 1987 winter wheat and feedgrains  farmers hit by midwestern flooding last year to receive at  least 92 pct of their federal income support payments even if  they did not plant.  The one-time pilot 0/92 program designed to assist farmers  in Kansas Oklahoma Michigan and parts of Missouri was passed  by a 304-100 vote and sent to the Senate.  Although the bill includes a narrow version of the 0/92  provision endorsed by the Reagan administration the U.S.  Agriculture Department withheld its support from the measure.  USDA said the bill would discourage farmers from buying  crop insurance and fall short of the administration s proposed  broad-scale revision of farm programs.  The bill would permit winter wheat producers prevented from  planting their 1987 crop last fall to receive 92 pct of the  deficiency payments they would have received.  To be eligible winter wheat farmers could not plant a  different crop on that land this spring although they could  use the land for grazing or to plant hay.  USDA estimated this provision would save 30 mln dlrs  largely because of reduced crop forfeitures.  The bill also would aid about 200 feedgrains producers  along the Missouri and Mississippi Rivers who were prevented  from planting crops this year because of residual damage from  last fall s flooding.  In addition the measure would require USDA to make full  payment to farmers eligible for emergency assistance approved  by Congress last fall.  Currently because claims have outstripped the 400 mln dlrs  in appropriated funds USDA plans to offer farmers in the  region 74 cents for every dollar in disaster losses.  The administration said it opposed the bill because by  expanding the 400 mln dlrs in disaster relief it would thwart  efforts to encourage farmers to buy crop insurance as an  alternative to federal disaster assistance.  USDA also said the 0/92 provisions in the bill were  narrower than the administration s proposal to offer the option  to all major commodities and would produce insignificant  savings.  USDA said the 0/92 option for 1987 winter wheat farmers  would produce a net savings of about 30 mln dlrs while the  requirement to compensate fully disaster-struck farmers would  cost about 135 mln dlrs which must be appropriated by  Congress. The feedgrains provision would cost about five mln  dlrs.  USDA estimated the overall cost of the bill to be 111 mln  dlrs.  In January the Senate approved a bill that would make 1987  winter wheat farmers eligible for disaster assistance payments.  But the Senate bill would not offer the 0/92 option to  wheat and feedgrains producers or raise the 400-mln dlr ceiling  on the disaster assistance program.    47\n",

      " U.S. CERTIFICATES TO PROVIDE WHEAT/CORN SUPPLIES  From April through December 1986  the Commodity Credit Corporation (CCC) issued 3.85 billion dlrs  worth of generic certificates and about 1.8 billion had not  been exchanged by January 1 1987 the U.S. Agriculture  Department said.  The department said an additional 4.3 billion dlrs in  certificates has been authorized for issuance during  January-August 1987  These certificates will provide ample free supplies of corn  and wheat for the remainder of the crop year the department  said in a summary of its Agricultural Outlook report.  Freeing of stocks through certificates is making U.S. grain  more competitive on world markets it said.  The department said last summer for example certificates  were exchanged for 215 mln bushels of corn. This helped  increase marketable supplies so farm-level corn prices  averaged about two dlrs per bushel -- somewhat lower than they  would have otherwise.  The lower prices probably led to an increase in usage of 40  to 50 mln bushels it said.  The department said government spending on farm programs in  fiscal year 1987 is projected to fall half a billion dlrs from  1986 s 25.8 billion dlrs.  During 1988 and 1989 the cost escalation of the first half  of the 1980 s will reverse. If current policy remains in force  annual farm program spending by 1992 will be down from last  year s record by more than eight billion dlrs it said.  The department said the President s budget proposals for  1988-1992 would cut farm program spending an additional 24  billion dlrs.  In 1987 foreign economic growth is expected to remain  close to 2.6 pct the same as in 1986 but above the 2.4 pct  average of 1980-86 it said.  Partially because of this improvement U.S. export volume  is expected to rise in fiscal 1987 for the frist time in seven  years the department said.    48\n",

      " U.S. CORN MARKET SKEWED BY SOVIET BUYING  Recent purchases of U.S. corn by the  Soviet Union have skewed the domestic cash market by increasing  the price difference between the premium price paid at the Gulf  export point and interior levels cash grain dealers said.  Many dealers expect the USDA will act soon to reduce the  cash price premium at the Gulf versus the interior -- which a  dealer in Davenport Iowa said was roughly 20 pct wider than  normal for this time of year at 25 cents a bushel -- by making  it worthwhile for farmers to move grain.  By lowering ASCS county posted prices for corn the USDA  could encourage farmers to engage in PIK and roll corn sales  where PIK certificates are used to redeem corn stored under the  government price support loan program and then marketed.  If the USDA acts soon as many dealers expect the movement  would break the Gulf corn basis.  The USDA has been using the Gulf price to determine county  posted prices one dealer said. It should be taking the  average of the Gulf price and the price in Kansas City which  would more closely reflect the lower prices in the interior  Midwest.  But we don t know when they might do it an Ohio dealer  said which has created uncertainty in the market.  The USDA started the PIK certificate program in an effort  to free up surplus grain that otherwise would be forfeited to  the government and remain off the market and in storage.  Yesterday USDA issued a report showing that only slightly  more than 50 pct of the 3.85 billion dlrs in PIK certificates  it has issued to farmers (in lieu of cash payments) had to date  been exchanged for grain.  With several billion dlrs worth of additional PIK  certificates scheduled to be issued in the coming months the  USDA would be well advised to encourage the exchange for grain  by adjusting the ASCS prices cash grain dealers said.  A byproduct of the Soviet buying has been a sharp rise in  barge freight costs quoted for carrying grain from the Midwest  to the export terminals cash dealers said.  Freight from upper areas of the Mississippi have risen  nearly 50 pct in the past two weeks to over 150 pct of the  original tariff price. The mild winter and early reopening of  the mid-Mississippi river this spring have also encouraged the  firmer trend in barge freight dealers noted.  The higher transportation costs have served to depress  interior corn basis levels squeezing the margins obtained by  the elevators feeding the Gulf export market as well as  discouraging farmer marketings they said.  The Gulf market overreacted to the Soviet buying reports  which indicate the USSR has booked over two and perhaps as much  as 4.0 mln tonnes of U.S. corn one Midwest cash grain trader  said.  But dealers anticipate that once the rumors subside  freight rates will settle back down because of the overall  surplus of barges on the Midwest river system.    49\n",

Implementation of a 0/92 program a tightening up of the  use of commodity certificates and reconstitution of farms are  possibilities that will be studied to reduce farm spending  said Dan Glickman D-Kans. chairman of the House agriculture  subcommittee on wheat soybeans and feedgrains.  Speaking at the annual meeting of the National Grain and  Feed Association Glickman said he learned this week from the  House budget committee that the agriculture committee will have  to reduce the fiscal year 1988 farm budget by up to two billion  dlrs from the 30 billion dlrs level already approved.  Decisions on how to cut the farm budget will have to be  made very quickly in order to make any impact on the FY 1988  budget Glickman added.  Glickman also said his committee will not approve USDA s  proposal to cut target prices by ten pct per year.  The administration s target price proposals are dead in  the water he said.  To cut the budget Glickman said everthing is on the  table except those moves that would reduce farmers income.  Glickman offered a list of possibilities that his committee  will study in order to cut farm spending.  Implementation of a 0/92 program for 1987 winter wheat and  1988 feedgrains crops has been introduced by Glickman which he  said would result in a 150-200 mln dlr savings for one year.  Tightening up on the use of generic (in-kind or pik )  certificates will also be another option his committee will  study Glickman said.  While not committing himself for or against such action he  said lawmakers have to examine recent government findings which  indicate certificates cost more than cash payments.  Glickman said rules for the reconstitution of farms and  tightening up of the person definition for annual payment  limitations is another option and could save 100-200 mln dlrs.  He also said increasing acreage set-aside requirements by  five pct for wheat and feedgrains at program sign-up was a move  that could save about one billion dlrs but added that he would  not be in favor of such a change.  Glickman also said that the Export Enhancement Program s  EEP spending authority of 1.5 billion dlrs is quickly being  used up and Congress will have to decide whether to expand  this program while making cuts in other areas.  Cuts in the EEP program are unlikely he said.  I don t see right now that the EEP will be on the chopping  block Glickman said.    49\n",

      " ARGENTINE MAIZE SOYBEAN FORECASTS FALL  Argentine grain growers reduced  their estimates for maize and soybean production in the current  harvest in the week to yesterday trade sources said.  Soybean production for 1986/87 is now estimated to reach  between 7.7 and eight mln tonnes versus 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes  estimated a week ago and eight to 8.4 mln tonnes estimated in  mid-February.  But even the lowest of those estimates would be 8.5 to 12.7  pct greater than last year s total of 7.1 mln tonnes according  to official figures and would be a new record.  The total area planted with soybeans for this harvest was a  record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares and increased 10.8 to 13.8 pct  compared to the 3.3 mln hectares planted last year.  The change in yield estimates is due to very high  temperatures and inadequate rainfall since early in the year in  the soybean-producing belt of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe and  northern Buenos Aires province.  The heat and lack of rain combined to leave many soybean  pods empty especially in Cordoba.  Intense rains in recent weeks did not affect crops since  rainfall was slight in most main soybean-producing areas.  Rains in the week to yesterday were isolated and weak in  Buenos Aires province totalling between one and 10 mm. There  was no recorded rain in other grain-producing provinces.  With clear skies and seasonable temperatures fields were  able to dry in areas that had received heavy rains in recent  weeks allowing growers to accelerate the pace of maize  sunflower and sorghum harvesting.  Crops were considered in generally good condition though  it is still too early to judge whether the intense rains of  recent weeks caused any long-term damage.  The maize harvest advanced to between 20 and 22 pct of the  total area planted compared to 13 to 15 pct a week ago.  Total area planted with maize for this harvest stood at  3.58 to 3.78 mln hectares down two to seven pct from the 3.85  mln hectares planted in the previous harvest.  Total production for the current maize harvest is expected  to reach between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes versus 10 to 10.2 mln  tonnes estimated a week ago. The new figure is 21.1 to 22.7 pct  lower than the 12.8 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest  according to official figures.  The sunflower harvest advanced to between 20 and 23 pct of  total planted area versus 15 to 18 pct a week ago.  Total area planted with sunflower for this harvest was two  to 2.2 mln hectares or 29.9 to 36.3 pct lower than the record  3.14 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.  The current harvest s volume was again expected to be  between 2.3 and 2.6 mln tonnes or 34.1 to 41.5 pct lower than  last harvest s record 4.1 mln tonnes.  Yields varied widely from area to area and growers feared  that heavy rains in recent weeks may have taken their toll on  crops and consequently on total production volume.  The sorghum harvest reached between nine and 11 pct of  total planted area compared to four to six pct a week ago.  Total area planted with sorghum stood at between 1.2 and  1.3 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct lower than the 1.4 mln  hectares planted in the previous harvest.  Estimates for total sorghum production this harvest  remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes again this week or 16.7 to  22 pct lower than last harvest s total volume of 4.1 to 4.2 mln  tonnes.    49\n",

      " OECD FARM SUBSIDIES STUDY RESULTS DETAILED  The results of a controversial study  of farm subsidies conducted by the Paris-based Organisation for  Economic Cooperation and Development OECD show Japan has the  highest agriculture subsidies in the world and that dairy  farmers benefit more than any other commodity producers from  subsidies.  Results of the study which has not been released by OECD  because of objections from some countries were provided to  Reuters by officials of several countries on condition they not  be identified.  The OECD study calculates the level of farm subsidies for  the years 1979-81 using a new measure called the producer  subsidy equivalent PSE.  The study shows that on dairy products Japan s PSE or the  amount of aid to farmers expressed as a percentage averaged  83.3 pct over 1979-81 with the European Community at 68.8 pct  and the United States 48.2 pct.  For wheat Japan s PSE averaged 95.8 pct the EC 28.1 and  the U.S. 17.2. Japan s rice PSE was 68.8 pct compared to the EC  13.6 and the U.S. 5.4 pct the OECD calculations show.  In coarse grains Japan s subsidies reached 107.1 pct  compared with 27.9 pct for the EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S.  Japan s beef subsidy was 54.9 pct versus 52.7 pct for the EC  and 9.5 pct for the U.S. OECD concluded.  For sugar Japan s PSE was 48.4 pct versus 27.9 pct in the  EC and 13.1 pct for the U.S. the study shows.  The OECD calculated farm subsidies for other industrial  countries such as Canada Australia and New Zealand but in most  cases the results were much lower than for the U.S. EC and  Japan the sources said.  Subsidies in Argentina and Brazil two major developing  country producers of commodities were not included in the OECD  work.  Officials said they hope to persuade reluctant countries to  release the study soon perhaps coinciding with the OECD  ministerial meeting in Paris during May.  Some officials hope the OECD results will be used as a  basis for negotiations during the Uruguay round of global trade  talks now underway in Geneva.  British Agriculture Minister Michael Jopling during a visit  to Washington this week endorsed the OECD work as a starting  point for the Uruguay round negotiations on agriculture.  He said the PSE calculations provide a tool to negotiate  down domestic farm support levels which are a major cause of  the present crisis in world agriculture.  However the OECD study results are controversial because  they highlight the levels of assistance to farmers officials  familiar with the study said.  The U.S. Agriculture Department s Economic Research Service  recently published a study of farm subsidies in an attempt to  verify the OECD results and update them to 1982-84.  In some cases the results were substantially different than  the OECD s in part because farm policies in both the U.S. and  elsewhere had changed markedly by 1982-84 from the OECD base  period of 1979-81 U.S. officials said.  For example the USDA study found the United States  subsidies to corn producers were higher in 1982-84 at 25 to 49  pct than in the EC at zero to nine pct.  French Maize Producers Association president Marcel Cazale  citing the result of the USDA calculation for corn told  reporters last week that the United States subsidizes its  farmers more than the EC.  However the sources said EC corn subsidies are probably  higher than the U.S. now because of increases since 1984.  Officials of several countries have been asked to  contribute data to OECD so that the study can be updated to  1985 subsidy levels a much more relevant measure of the  current world farm situation.  The updated calculations which may take several months to  complete are expected to show substantial increases in U.S.  subsidy levels for sugar because the U.S. imposed restrictive  import quotas in 1982 as aid to the domestic industry.  U.S. subsidy levels also are increased by the 1985 farm  bill which sharply boosted government deficiency payments to  grain farmers and applied a marketing loan for rice officials  added.    50\n",

      " SOVIET TIMECHARTERING BOOSTS GRAIN FREIGHT RATES  Current interest by Soviet charterers in  taking Panamax vessels on timecharter mainly from the U.S. To  carry grain is seen as the chief factor behind the recent  surge in values on the Baltic International Freight Futures  Exchange (BIFFEX) dealers said.  Futures soared through the 1 000 points barrier today for  the first time in the spot position since the market opened in  May 1985. However the market tends to be nervous with values  some 100 points above the Baltic Freight Index which is  calculated on spot physical rates.  No specific figure has been put for Soviet bookings but  they have been sufficient to drain Panamax tonnage (about 50 000 to 65 000 tonnes dw) from the U.S. Gulf which would  normally operate on the trip to Japan dealers said.  It appears that the Chernobyl disaster had a worse effect  on its (the Soviet) grain harvest than reported one said.  Freight rates on the Gulf/Japan grain route have  subsequently been the main beneficiary of current chartering  conditions with very few if any Panamax sized ships left for  the remainder of this month in the Gulf. Rates have risen  steadily for vessels loading next month.  Dealers said there is even talk that owners are considering  taking older vessels out of lay-up to meet current demand.  Sentiment has also been aided by suggestions that Chinese  operators may be in the market for similar timecharter business  later in the year they said.  They anticipate this would appear around June and it has  prompted keen demand in the July BIFFEX contract despite it  normally being a slack time in the shipping year.  Market sentiment has fluctuated in recent weeks. Rates  turned down as an earlier rise in bunker prices which had  supported the market at the start of the year faltered but  then recovered on the reported Soviet interest.    50\n",

      " U.S. GRAIN TRADE CALLS SHULTZ REMARK SIGNIFICANT  A statement yesterday by Secretary  of State George Shultz after he met with wheat growers that  U.S. agricultural products must be competitively priced was  significant in that he recognized the importance of the Soviet  market and the need for U.S. prices to be at world market  levels U.S. grain trade industry officials said.  They said that Shultz s comments while not explicitly  endorsing subsidized wheat sales to the USSR were noteworthy  because they were not negative towards such action.  In response to a query on what the State Department s  position is on selling subsidized wheat to Moscow Shultz told  the leaders of the National Association of Wheat Growers that  prices must be competitive if the U.S. is going to trade.  The Soviet Union the world s largest grain importer has  bought no U.S. wheat for more than a year complaining the  price was far above world market levels. A U.S. offer last fall  to sell the Soviets lower-priced wheat through the export  enhancement program EEP was also rebuffed due to the price.  Shultz was said to be adamantly against the U.S. wheat  offer last year and has been reported to be one of the major  obstacles in making another subsidy overture to the Soviet  Union grain industry sources said.  Intense speculation the U.S. might make a fresh EEP wheat  offer to the Soviets has boosted grain prices significantly in  recent trading sessions. Kansas City hard wheat futures rose  another 2-1/4 cents by midday at 2.88-1/4 dlrs per bushel  while CBT March wheat was up 1-1/2 cents at 2.92-1/2 dlrs.  I m not sure this is an about-face but it s clearly a  recognition that unless we re competitive we won t sell to the  Soviet Union said a lobbyst for a major commodity group.  We have to be competitive. It s ridiculous to say that  somebody is going to buy your product if they can get the same  thing at a lower price somewhere else Shultz told the farm  leaders. That is our approach in negotiations with the  Soviets he said.  If those comments do signal that the State Department is no  longer opposed to the U.S. selling wheat to the USSR under EEP  it certainly improves the chances for an EEP wheat offer to  Moscow an industry lobbyst said.  National Wheat Grower s officials were taking a cautious  attitude towards the secretary s comments.  His comments were not discouraging but they didn t in our  judgment promise any immediate action on EEP an official with  the wheat group said.  The Wheat Growers official noted however that there is  significance in that fact that we haven t seen any significant  negative commentary on the idea of EEP wheat to the Soviets.  In a meeting with exporters this week Secretary of  Agriculture Richard Lyng refused to comment on their request  that the administration offer subsidized wheat to Moscow the  officials said.  An aide to USDA undersecretary Daniel Amstutz who is  reported to be strongly opposed to EEP wheat to the Soviets  said that the Shultz comments are consistent with what he  (Shultz) has taught for years as an economist but said they  don t necessarily relate to the Soviet Union.  Amstutz could not be reached for comment and an aide to  Lyng said Lyng would not comment on Shultz s statements.  But trade sources were hopeful that the Shultz comments may  indicate some movement towards EEP wheat to Moscow.  If he didn t say no then there s a chance. This is  potentially a positive development a commodity source said.    51\n",

      " EC TO ABOLISH TAX ON SPANISH MAIZE EXPORTS  The European Community Commission has  decided to abolish a special tax of eight Ecus per tonne  imposed on exports of Spanish maize Commission sources said.  They said the tax which applies to Spanish sales to EC and  non-EC countries alike would no longer be required on exports  from Spanish ports south of Valencia.  The decision was taken at a meeting of the authority s  cereals management committee today.  The tax had been introduced last September at the same time  as a subsidy of eight Ecus per tonne was brought in for exports  of maize to Spain from other EC member countries.  The aim of the tax was to prevent the maize imported into  Spain from the other EC states with the help of subsidies from  being reexported back to them.  The sources added that Spain had received no answer from  the committee to its request that tenders be opened for the  sale to third countries of 450 000 tonnes of maize.  The request will be considered at the committee s next  meeting the commission sources said.  Madrid estimates that it needs to import 1.7 mln tonnes of  maize this year while an EC-U.S. accord guarantees non-EC  producer sales to Spain of two mln tonnes of maize and 300 0  tonnes of sorghum annually for the next four years.    51\n",

      " U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION  All major grain producing countries  must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the  recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed two U.S.  wheat organizations said.  The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point  for discussions but we do not want the Australians to feel  they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions on world  grain trade the president of the National Association of Wheat  Growers NAWG and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said  in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S.  Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.  Future discussions on international wheat trade should  include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of  government-run export trading entities a commitment to public  disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are  involved and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S.  have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be the  two organizations said  While the Australian proposals are welcome the two  organizations said they are not in total agreement with their  assessments.  Australia s proposals which aim to reduce U.S. target  prices and quarantine U.S. wheat stocks would continue to  place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S.  farmers they said.  Other countries including Australia have benefitted  from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S.  acreage and crop reduction programs the organizations said.  We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and  subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking  grain and changing programs which protect our growers Jim  Miller president of NAWG said.  We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the  world s major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and  restore profitability to agriculture Miller said.    51\n",

      " SHULTZ NOT OPPOSED TO WHEAT SUBSIDY TO SOVIETS  Secretary of State George Shultz has  decided not to oppose any U.S. wheat subsidy offer to the  Soviet Union and has left the final decision on whether to sell  subsidized wheat to Moscow up to President Reagan and the  Agriculture Department a State Department official said.  Shultz feels like he fought the battle against a subsidy  last summer and he s not going to the mat again. It s now  basically the USDA who has to make their decisions as to what  they want to do the official said.  If USDA decides to go ahead with a subsidy offer to the  Soviet Union he said Shultz will not wage a vigorous  campaign against it. He might not come out in favor of it but  he won t go to the President and voice his objections.  In an official statement clarifying Shultz s remarks  yesterday to leaders of the National Association of Wheat  Growers the State Department said Secretary Shultz expressed  his belief that whenever possible U.S. grain should be  competitive on world markets including the Soviet Union.  The Agriculture Department is in the best position to  determine whether consideration should be given at this time to  extending to the Soviets a subsidy under the Export Enhancement  Program.  Although Shultz will not oppose a wheat subsidy to the  Soviets there remain obstacles to another subsidy offer to  Moscow the State Department official said.  Everyone in the government agrees that if there is a  subsidy to be offered we would not offer it unless we had a  firm commitment from the Soviets that they would buy.  USDA does not want a repetition of last summer when the  USSR baulked at its offer of four mln tonnes of subsidized  wheat the official who asked not to be identified said.  The Soviets rejected the U.S. offer then on the grounds  that the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy was insufficient to bring  U.S. prices down to competitive levels.  The Soviets want a higher subsidy offer this time the  State Department source said.  What the Soviets want is something equivalent to the  lowest price being paid by anyone in the world he said.  The Soviets argue that they are the best customer of the  U.S. and that they are entitled to the best price he said.  Government and commodity sources also said there are  elements in the USDA most notably undersecretary Daniel  Amstutz who remain opposed to a wheat subsidy to the Soviets.  Subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union is still not a  foregone conclusion the State Department official said.    51\n",

      " ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - ASIAN DROUGHTS  Three geographically diverse droughts  in Asia are being linked by some scientists to a  reintensification of the complex and little-understood El Nino  weather pattern &lt;Accu-Weather Inc> a commercial weather  forecasting service said.  Rice and wheat farmers in China wheat and sugarcane  growers in Australia and tea planters in Sri Lanka all face  serious losses to their respective harvests unless rains arrive  in time to break the droughts offical reports government  officials and meteorologists said.  Wen Wei Po a Hong Kong daily with close Peking links said  the drought is the worst in over 20 years and some provinces  have been without adequate rainfall for more than seven months.  Rice planting is threatened in eight provinces it added.  Rainfall in the key farming provinces of Henan and Sichuan  was 70 pct below average during February the lowest figure for  over 20 years the paper said.  The dry weather has cut stored water volumes by over 20 pct  compared with last March and lowered the water levels of many  rivers it added.  This has resulted in reduced hydro-electric power causing  shortages to industry and households. The upper reaches of the  Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century causing many  ships to run aground Wen Wei Po said.  Unusually high temperatures have also been reported across  China media reports said. The People s Daily said Sichuan has  recorded temperatures three degrees Celsius higher than average  since early February.  The New China News Agency said the average December  temperature in Harbin in the northeast was six degrees higher  than last December and 14 degrees higher than December 1984.  Severe drought is affecting about one-third of Sri Lanka  and threatens to reduce the country s tea crop Ministry of  Plantation Industries officials told Reuters  In Australia concern is growing about below-average  rainfall levels in parts of the sugarcane belt along the  Queensland coast and in Western Australia s wheat belt local  Meteorological Bureau officials said.  For many farmers and government officials the fear is that  while the present low rainfall does not yet pose a major  threat the prospect of a dry autumn/winter season when the  wheat crop is in its early stages certainly does they added.  Concern is heightened by the memory of the 1982/83 drought  which devastated the wheat crop and coincided with the  occurrence of the barely understood weather phenomenon known as  El Nino they said.  Although meteorologists are cautious about linking the  Asia-Pacific region s disrupted weather patterns to any single  cause El Nino s role is being closely studied they said.  Accu-Weather Inc which specialises in providing data for  agriculture and shipping interests said each El Nino event  was unique.  The El Nino does not always produce the same effects and  the present occurrence is much less pronounced than the last  major event in 1982/83 it said.  El Nino Spanish for Christ Child because it appears around  Christmas is formed by the action of warm air bearing clouds  and rain shifting from the Indonesian archipelago to the coast  of Peru where it mingles with the cold waters associated with  the Peru current and returns across the Pacific as the trade  winds meteorologists said.  The winds strengthened by El Nino s pump effect raise the  sea level off Australia and Indonesia they said.  When the winds drop the ocean seeking equilibrium sends  a surge of warmer water back across the Pacific where it  collides with the cold seas off Peru they said.  One effect of this heat exchange is to deflect the  rain-bearing clouds away from Australia and Indonesia into the  Pacific where they further disrupt other weather patterns.  The prospects for an end to the droughts vary Accu-Weather  said.  China where the affected areas have received between 40  and 75 pct of normal rainfall will have to wait for the  May-September rains it said.  The May-September rains normally provide the  drought-striken areas with 80 pct of annual rainfall.  In Australia areas of Queensland s coastal strip have  received less than half the normal rainfall during the current  wet season but prospects for increased rains are diminishing  as the rainy season draws to an end.  In Sri Lanka the drought has come when rainfall should be  at its maximum for the year. The year s secondary rains usually  occur between April and June although it is not possible at  this stage to forecast whether they will arrive as usual.    52\n",

      " USDA NOT PLANNING ANY MAJOR PRICING CHANGES  The Agriculture Department is not  considering any major changes in its pricing system for posted  county prices an Agriculture Department offical said.  We do not have current plans to make any major adjustments  or changes in our pricing said Bob Sindt USDA assistant  deputy administrator for commodity operations.  U.S. grain traders and merchandisers said earlier this week  USDA might act soon to reduce the cash corn price premium at  the Gulf versus interior price levels by dropping ASCS posted  prices to encourage interior PIK and roll movement.  But Sindt denied USDA is planning any such changes.  If people are suggesting that we are going to make  wholesale changes in pricing we are not considering this he  said.  Sindt however did not rule out the possiblity of  implementing more minor changes in its pricing system.  We are continually monitoring the whole nationwide  structure to maintain its accuracy he said. If we become  convinced that we need to make a change then appropriate  adjustments will be made.  Sindt acknowledged that concern has been voiced that USDA s  price differentials between the New Orleans Gulf and interior  markets are not accurate because of higher than normal barge  freight rates.  He said commodity operations deputy administrator Ralph  Klopfenstein is currently in the midwest on a speaking tour and  will meet with ASCS oficials in Kansas City next week.  Sindt said a number of issues will be discussed at that  meeting including the current concern over the gulf corn  premiums.  He defended the USDA differentials saying that these price  margins reflect an average of prices throughout the year and  that seasonal factors will normally cause prices to increase or  decrease.  The USDA official also said that only those counties that  use the Gulf to price grain are being currently affected by the  high barge freight tariffs and increased gulf prices.  When asked if the USDA emergency storage program which  allows grain to be stored in barges was taking up barge space  and accounting for the higher freight rates Sindt discounted  the idea.  He said USDA has grain left in only about 250 barges and  that under provisions of the program these all have to be  emptied by the end of March.    52\n",

      " CONCERN OVER EL NINO IN PERU - USDA REPORT  There are heightened fears that El  Nino may be returning to Peru with an intensity approaching the  1983 disaster which affected the weather on several continents  and caused widespread damage through floods and drought the  U.S. Agriculture Department s officer in Lima said in a field  report.  Continued heavy rains in the northern coastal area  flooding of several major rivers and mud slides have led to  increased concern the report dated March 17 said.  However it said official sources still believe that this  year s El Nino will have only weak to moderate intensity.  EL Nino is a phenomenon involving a shift in winds and  waters in the pacific.  The USDA report said that so far the El Nino now being  experienced has not had an overall negative impact on  agricultural production.  Excessive rains in the Piura Pima cotton area may reduce  yields by about 20 pct due to excessive growth too early in the  crop cycle.  Also insect damage to crops could be more extensive where  excessive moisture exists it said.  However the El Nino has resulted in a much improved supply  of irrigation water in the major dams which will improve  prospects for many crucial crops such as rice and corn and  slow the decline in sugar production it said.  If El Nino picks up momentum Peru s fishing industry could  receive a setback. But trade sources still believe the fish  catch for industrial processing will reach 5.5 mln tonnes in 1987 almost 20 pct above last year the report said.  Water temperatures in the northern fishing areas are three  to four degrees centigrade above normal but still not high  enough to drive the fish to cooler southern waters it said.  It said there is still the outside chance that El Nino will  intensify and carry on through late March April and May  causing problems as crops approach harvest.  There appears to be no way to project the course of El Nino  -- only time will tell the report said.    52\n",

      " ANALYST SAYS USSR WINTER GRAINS HURT BY WEATHER  The Soviet Union s winter grain  crop is likely to have suffered losses due to dry planting  conditions last fall and severe cold this winter an analyst of  world weather and crop conditions said.  Grain analyst and meteorologist Gail Martell author of the  EF Hutton publication Global Crop News said in her latest  report that the Soviets may import more grain possibly wheat  from the U.S. due to potential crop damage.  Compared with last year the outlook (for the Soviet  winter grain crop) is far more pessimistic she said. But  it s still too early to talk about disastrous losses. A lot  will depend on spring weather not only for the outcome of the  troubled winter grain crop but also for spring planting.  Martell said the dry weather conditions last fall probably  prevented optimal seed germination for winter grains. Key wheat  growing areas of the southern Ukraine and North Caucasus  received on 25-35 pct of autumn precipitation she said.  The bitter winter cold temperatures -- which broke record  lows that had stood for four decades -- also may have taken its  toll on Soviet winter crops she said.  However she noted that most of the southern grain belt had  ample snow cover which should have well-insulated the majority  of crop areas from severe frost damage.  The USSR has already bought 20 to 21 mln tonnes of grains  in the July 1986/June 1987 marketing year primarily from  Canada the European Community Argentina and Australia  Martell said.  She cited a number of reasons besides possible crop  problems that might point to additional Soviet import demand.  Last fall s dry weather may limit livestock grazing on  moisture-depleted pastures while the cold winter weather  necessitated supplemental feeding to keep livestock healthy.  Martell was also skeptical of a Soviet claim for a 1986  grain harvest of 210 mln tonnes and said the Chernobyl  accident may have contaminated more grain than originally  thought and have to be made up with imports.  However she said the U.S. remains a supplier of last  resort for the Soviet Union noting that the Soviets have only  just recently begun their first U.S. grain purchases of the  1986/87 season by buying 2.25 mln tonnes of corn.  Martell cited USDA statistics showing that since the 1980  grain embargo the U.S. is only a major supplier of grain to the  USSR during years of heavy Soviet demand.  In 1984/85 the U.S. supplied 41 pct of record Soviet grain  imports of 55.5 mln tonnes. But in 1985/86 the Soviet Union  bought 29.9 mln tonnes of grain and turned to the U.S. for only  24 pct of that total.  While the USDA Soviet import target for grain for 1986/87  was 22 mln tonnes many U.S. grain analysts have revised their  estimates of Soviet imports up to 25-28 mln tonnes she said.    52\n",

In a summary of its World Agriculture Report the  department said grain production in sub-Saharan Africa was a  record high in 1986 with gains in almost every country.  However food needs in Central America rose worsened by  drought-reduced crops and civil strife.  Record wheat production in 1986/87 is pushing global wheat  consumption for food to a new high and higher yielding  varieties have been particularly effective where spring wheat  is a common crop it said.  However may developing countries in tropical climates  such as Sub-Saharan Africa Southeast Asia and Central  America are not well adapted for wheat production and  improved varieties are not the answer to rising food needs the  department said.

      " U.S. SUGAR PROGRAM CUT SENT TO CONGRESS BY USDA  The U.S. Agriculture Department  formally transmitted to Congress a long-awaited proposal to  drastically slash the sugar loan rate and compensate growers  for the cut with targeted income payments.  In a letter to the Congressional leadership accompanying  the Sugar Program Improvements Act of 1987 Peter Myers  Deputy Agriculture Secretary said the Reagan administration  wants the sugar loan rate cut to 12 cents per pound beginning  with the 1987 crop down from 18 cts now.  Sugarcane and beet growers would be compensated by the  government for the price support cut with targeted income  payments over the four years 1988 to 1991. The payments would  cost an estimated 1.1 billion dlrs Myers said.  The administration sugar proposal is expected to be  introduced in the House of Representatives next week by Rep.  John Porter R-Ill.  Congressional sources said the program cut is so drastic it  is unlikely to be adopted in either the House or Senate because  politically-influential sugar and corn growers  and high fructose corn syrup producers will strongly resist.  The direct payment plan outlined by the administration  targets subsidies to small cane and beet growers and gradually  lowers payments over four years. It also excludes from payment  any output exceeding 20 000 short tons raw sugar per grower.  For example on the first 350 tons of production a grower  would receive 6 cts per lb in fiscal 1988 4.5 cts in 1989 3  cts in 1990 and 1.5 cts in 1991.  The income payments would be based on the amount of  commercially recoverable sugar produced by a farmer in the 1985  or 1986 crop years whichever is less USDA said.  Myers said the administration is proposing drastic changes  in the sugar program because the current high price support is  causing adverse trends in the sugar industry.  He said the current program has artificially stimulated  domestic sugar and corn sweetener production which has allowed  corn sweeteners to make market inroads.  U.S. sugar consumption has declined which has resulted in a  progressive contraction of the sugar import quota to only one  mln short tons this year he said. This has hurt cane sugar  refiners who rely on imported sugar processing.  Furthermore USDA said the current sugar program gives  overseas manufacturers of sugar-containing products a  competitive advantage. The result has been higher imports of  sugar-containing products and a flight of U.S. processing  facilities overseas to take advantage of cheaper sugar.  USDA also said the current program imposes a heavy cost on  U.S. consumers and industrial users. In fiscal 1987 USDA said  consumers are paying nearly two billion dlrs more than  necessary for sugar.  Enactment of this bill will reduce the price gap between  sweeteners and help to correct or stabilize the many adverse  impacts and trends which the sugar industry is currently  facing Myers said.  The following table lists the rate of payments in cts per  lb to growers and the quantity covered in short tons  recoverable raw sugar under the administration s proposal to  compensate sugar growers with targeted payments.

      " STRIKE THREAT LOWER TRAFFIC MAR SEAWAY OPENING  The St. Lawrence Seaway set  to reopen March 31 after the winter faces another tough year  because of depressed traffic levels and the possibility of the  first strike in 20 years on the Great Lakes seaway officials  said.  Depressed grain exports rising costs and competing modes  of transportation are all expected to result in only a marginal  increase over last year s traffic levels -- and revenues -- on  the 2 300 mile waterway officials said.  In 1986 a season that ran from April 3 to December 27 the  seaway moved 37.6 mln metric tons of freight between Montreal  and Lake Ontario and 41.6 mln tons on the Welland Canal  linking Lake Erie and Lake Ontario.  By comparison in 1985 about 37 mln tons of cargo traveled  through the Montreal-Lake Ontario section and 42 mln through  the eight-lock canal.  The waterway is expected to lose 9-10 mln Canadian dlrs  this year about the same as the estimated deficit for fiscal  1986-87 ending March 31 said William Blair an executive  member of Canada s St Lawrence Seaway Authority.  The seaway moves about one-half of Canada s exported grain.  Those exports of the single most important commodity carried on  the waterway have been depressed by world surpluses.  The Seafarers International Union which represents about 2 300 workers on the Great Lakes and the ocean coasts has said  it will likely go on strike this spring to protest employers  demands for wage rollbacks and other concessions.  It s 99.9 pct (certain)--I guarantee you a strike Roman  Gralewicz head of the Seafarers Canadian branch has said.  The Canadian government has called in a labor conciliator  to try to hammer out a contract agreement between the two  sides. The seaway authority said a walkout tying up ships on  the Great Lakes would badly hurt traffic.  We haven t had a strike on the seaway for years...a  prolonged strike would have a disasterous effect Seaway  Authority spokeswoman Gay Hemsley said.  These are the heaviest contract talks in the history of the  St Lawrence Seaway George Miller vice-president of the  Canadian Lake Carriers Association an association of major  Canadian shipping companies said recently.  The workers current contract expires May 31. The  association said it is asking for a five per cent cut in wages  for the next three years reduced crew levels and the power to  restructure crew dispatching.  The association said its members recorded about a 6 mln dlrs  (U.S.) loss in each of 1985 and 1986 due to lower traffic and  freight rates and increasing competition. The seaway said 1985  was its worst year in two decades.  Hemsley said the seaway authority plans to raise tolls on  the Welland Canal by eight pct this year compared to last  year s 15 pct rise while maintaining a freeze on tolls  throughout the rest of the waterway.  Canada is responsible for 13 of the seaway s 15 locks and  about 85 pct of its revenues and maintenance costs.  We may see and hope for a steady upward climb...but we  won t see a major increase for a number of years Hemsley said.  A Canada-U.S. delegation to promote the seaway to shippers  in Western Europe should result in some increased traffic this  season but the full benefits won t be felt for several years  Blair said.    53\n",

For the first stage Beghin-Say will issue some 2.05 mln new  65 franc shares at 500 francs to increase capital to 660 mln  francs. The share currently trades at 734 francs. Then 658 0  new 65 franc investment certificates will be issued at 400  francs raising capital to 703 mln francs.  The capital increase will bring the group around 1.2  billion francs in new funds to finance its expansion plans.  These include the possible acquisition of the Corn Products  maize starch plant at Haubourdin in northern France Vernes  said.  Ferruzzi is one of several groups bidding to buy all of  Corn Products installations in Europe. Apart from the French  plant these include three factories in each of Italy and West  Germany two in Britain and Spain and one in the Netherlands  and Denmark.  Corn Products has put a 650 mln dlr price tag on the  installations and Beghin-Say estimates that acquisition of the  Haubourdin plant would cost between 80 and 100 mln dlrs Vernes  said.  If this bid fails Beghin-Say would consider acquiring and  developing two other French plants either in the maize or  wheat starch sector.  Beghin-Say is also planning to finance European expansion  for its Kaysersberg subsidiary another major reason for its  capital increase.  Kaysersberg which was transformed from a division of  Beghin-Say into a fully-fledged chemical subsidiary last year  has been holding talks with other European companies on  possible accords Vernes said.

      " AUSTRALIAN WHEAT AREA TO FALL FORECASTER SAYS  Australian wheat plantings are  forecast to fall to 10.40 mln hectares in 1987/88 from 11.72  mln sown in 1986/87 Australian Wheat Forecasters Pty Ltd (AWF)  said in its first preliminary crop forecast.  But there was no reason to expect Australian production in  1987/88 would be less than the 16.5 mln tonnes of last year  the private forecaster said as crops in New South Wales and  Queensland suffered from poor yields last season.  Most of the fall in plantings was expected in Western  Australia while state average yields would be assisted by  growers sowing wheat on fallows and rest paddocks it said.  The main reason for a low Western Australia estimate was a  poor profit outlook under cost credit and yield pressures. But  in the eastern states the wheat area should hold up provided  that rainfall between now and June is not less than average  AWF said.  Although some farmers were saying they intended to cut back  wheat area by 20 pct AWF said this was unlikely since they  needed cash flow and there were problems with alternative  crops.  The lack of statutory marketing for oilseeds pulses and  oats is a cause for concern if those crops are to comprise a  high proportion of growers income AWF said.

Aweke Aynalem head of the government s Agriculture  Development Department told reporters prospects were good for  attaining the target of 250 000 tonnes of grain in the present  growing season one of two each year in Ethiopia.  Normal crop production in Ethiopia is about 648 000 tonnes  a year of which 250 000 tonnes are produced from the belg  (small) rains which fall at this time of year.  The belg rains are used to plant quick-maturing crops like  maize and barley. Any shortfall during this period affects  production in the main rainy season because farmers eat their  stocks of seed.  Aweke said peasants in Wello Tigre and Hararghe -- regions  which suffered severely from drought -- were now able to sow  their crops because of the favourable rains.  The government had distributed large quantities of seed and  fertiliser and the rains should ensure a good crop.    53\n",

Barreto told reporters his aim was to have EPAC readmitted  to the tenders.  Under the terms of Portugal s January 1986 accession to the  European Community (EC) a grain import monopoly held by EPAC  (Empresa Publica de Abastecimento de Cereais) is being reduced  by 20 pct annually until all imports are liberalised in 1990.  Following legal proceedings by private importers Lisbon s  civil court decided in a preliminary ruling earlier this month  that EPAC should not be allowed to take part as it had done  in tenders for the liberalised share of annual grain imports.  As a result of this ruling EPAC was excluded from a March  12 tender for the import of 80 000 tonnes of maize.  Barreto said My objective is put EPAC into the tenders  because it has a right to take part. He added the government  would be studying the court order to see whether or not the  ruling could stop EPAC from participating in future tenders.  Barreto said there was no reason to exclude any operator  whether public or private from the tenders. Private traders  had argued that EPAC given its dominant position in the  Portuguese grain market had an unfair advantage over them.  There is no reason to make EPAC a martyr of the system  Barreto said. He said the EC s executive commission had  accepted the government s view that EPAC should be eligible.  The Lisbon court ruling stated that EPAC s participation in  the public tenders was unfair competition and violated the  clauses of Portugal s EC accession treaty dealing with the  gradual dismantling of the state agency s import monopoly.    54\n",

The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance  to the industry and the nature duration and extent of any aid  he said in a statement.  He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting  marketing arrangements to apply after June 30 1989 when the  underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing  Act expire.  Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full  examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.  The inquiry will be required to take into account changes  which have taken place in the industry as a result of the  agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and  the industry s capacity to adjust to any recommended changes  he said.  The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry  as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger  underwriting support from the government for the first time he  said.  Kerin was referring to the government s underwriting of the  guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian  Wheat Board near the start of the season.  The IAC s report will be due at the same time as the  findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage  Handling and Transport Kerin said.

      " EC COLD AID FOOD SCHEME MAY BE MADE PERMANENT  Emergency action to distribute  European Community (EC) food surpluses to the poor has proved  so successful that the EC executive Commission may propose a  permanent scheme a Commission spokesman said.  Almost 60 000 tonnes of food was taken out of EC stores  between January 20 when Agriculture Ministers approved the  scheme and March 13 according to latest commission figures.  The food including 30 000 tonnes of cereals 6 000 tonnes  of sugar 4 000 tonnes of beef and 13 300 tonnes of butter has  been distributed to the needy through charities.  The present scheme was approved as an emergency measure to  help poor people affected by this year s unusually cold winter  and will end on March 31.  But the spokesman said the commission will consider whether  to propose it be replaced by an all-year-round system.  The commission estimates that up to March 13 the temporary  scheme cost between 63 and 68 mln European currency units  (72/78 mln dlrs). This is above the 50 mln Ecu (57 mln dlr)  ceiling originally envisaged by the Ministers.  However commission sources said the real cost was small if  account is taken of the expense of keeping food in store until  its quality and value deteriorates.  On the other hand the impact of the temporary scheme on EC  food surpluses has been slight. EC surplus food stocks at  January 31 included 1.28 mln tonnes of butter 520 000 tonnes  of beef and over 10 mln tonnes of cereals.    55\n",

      " HEAVY SIGNUP SEEN IN 1987 CORN PROGRAM - USDA  With less than a week remaining to  enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program Agriculture Department  officials said that final signup will probably exceed last  year s level of 85 pct.  Enrollment in USDA s basic acreage reduction program will  likely total close to 90 pct Agricultural Stabilization and  Conservation Service ASCS officials said with 50 to 70 pct  of the enrolling farmers also expected to sign up for the paid  land diversion program.  The signup period of the 1987 feedgrains program officially  ends at the close of the business day on March 30.  USDA will release its official signup report around April 15 an official said.  USDA personnel in the corn belt states of Iowa Illinois  and Indiana have been reporting heavy signup activity an ASCS  official told Reuters.  A surge of acitivity is expected during this final week of  signup the official said.  A lot of farmers have been dragging their feet because  they were anticipating some changes in the program but that  doesn t look very likely now he said.  To enroll in the 1987 feedgrains program farmers have to  set aside 20 pct of the program acreage base and have the  option to idle an additional 15 pct under a paid land diversion  program.    55\n",

      " ILLINOIS CO-OP FUTURES DISSOLUTION VOTE SET  The shareholders of Illinois  Cooperative Futures Co. the futures trading arm of many  Midwest farm cooperatives for more than 25 years will vote  Wednesday on its possible dissolution.  The directors of the company called a special meeting and  recommended its dissolution last month citing falling volume  and increasing costs.  Sources close to the organization told Reuters the pullout  of Growmark Inc. which holds more than 70 pct of the capital  stock led to the call for dissolution.  The possible demise of the cooperative has set clearing  houses scrambling for the trading business of the 85 regional  and local cooperatives that comprise its membership.  Ironically it was Growmark at that time a regional farm  cooperative with major river terminal elevators that founded  Illinois Cooperative Futures on December 1 1960  But Growmark became affiliated last year with Archer  Daniels Midland of Decatur Ill. and markets its grain through  a joint subsidiary of the two companies ADM/Growmark.  With that relationship Growmark no longer needs to trade  futures through the cooperative said Tom Mulligan president  of the co-op.  Membership in the company which Mulligan termed a  cooperative of cooperatives has declined from 99 in 1982. A  notable loss was AgriIndustries of Iowa which became  affiliated with Cargill Inc.  Illinois Co-op s other members include such regional  cooperatives as Indiana Grain based in Indianapolis Goldkist  of Atlanta Ga. Midstates in Toledo Ohio Farmland Industries  in Kansas City Mo. Farmers Commodities Des Moines and  Harvest States in Minneapolis.  Some observors said the demise of Illinois Cooperative  Futures Co. is a serious blow to the cooperative system.  Instead of banding together the individual cooperatives  are forced to go their own ways said the floor manager of one  cash house at the Chicago Board of Trade.  Such a move would destroy the cohesiveness that gives farm  cooperatives an advantage in the market at a time that a few  major commercial companies are growing dominant he said.  Don Hanes vice president for communications with the  National Council of Farm Cooperatives said 5 600 cooperatives  exist today down from 6 700 five years ago.  The period we ve gone through in the past five years has  been quite a crunch he said. There s been a lot of  consolidation in the marketing co-ops.  One problem he said is the co-ops sell the grain to the  major commercials for export rather than exporting it  themselves losing potential profits.  But exporting grain requires heavy investments and the  multi-million-dollar loss posted six years ago by Farmers  Export Co. a co-op set up to export grains served to make  folks gun-shy Hanes said.  Mulligan said he believes the dissolution if it is  approved is a result of change in the futures industry rather  than a change in U.S. agricultural economics.  A grain dealer at one member co-op said the futures arm  was a convenience something that saved us a little bit of  money. (Its dissolution) will force us to change our way of  doing business.  We re sorry to see the co-op go by the wayside he said.  But there are lot of people out there to do business with.  There are plenty of capable firms.  Steven W. Cavanaugh vice president for grain marketing  with Indiana Grain said he would prefer to trade futures  through a Chicago-based cooperative.  In terms of clearing our business as a unit as opposed to  individuals there would be economic savings he said but  added The times change and with changing times come  different opinions of what businesses ought to be around.  Cavanaugh said the possible demise of the futures arm had  nothing to do with its profitability. I would guarantee you  that this company is not in trouble. It is a sound healthy  organization.  In the year ended February 28 1986 the Illinois  Cooperative reported income of 10.2 mln dlrs and members  equity or net worth of 8.3 mln dlrs. The annual report for  the most recent year has not been filed.  Under the cooperative system income from operations is  returned as patronage refunds to the members.  Income and refunds in the past five years have been  declining. In the year ended February 28 1982 the co-op  reported income of 17.4 mln dlrs and patronage refunds of 17.0  mln dlrs. Patronage refunds in the year ended February 28 1986 totalled 9.5 mln dlrs.  You re dealing with substantially lower volume Mulligan  said. Lower volume translates into higher costs.  According to the company s 1986 annual report Growmark  owns 90 pct of the preferred shares and four pct of the common  shares of Illinois Cooperative Futures Co.  Mulligan declined to speculate on how much of the capital  Growmark is entitled to. He said he could not determine the  figure unless the shareholders decide in favor of dissolution.  Equity is distributed according to each member s trading volume  and as a result changes from year to year.  However Mulligan said the company could continue to meet  minimum capital requirements to trade futures even if Growmark  pulled out.    55\n",

      " U.S. CORN ACREAGE SEEN NEAR RECORD LOW  U.S. corn acreage this year is  likely to drop to the lowest level since the unsurpassed  acreage reductions of the 1983 PIK year and could rank as one  of the lowest corn plantings in the United States in sixty  years Agriculture Department officials said.  USDA releases its official plantings report on March 31.  Agriculture Department analysts said next week s figures will  likely show a sharp drop in acreage to as low as 65 mln acres  down 22 pct from last year s plantings of 83.3 mln acres.  Assuming an 18 mln acre drop in plantings U.S. corn  production will also decrease significantly. Analysts said 1987  corn production could drop by over one billion bushels to  around seven billion bushels.  Expected signup of up to 90 pct in the 1987 feed grains  program along with 1.9 mln acres enrolled in the conservation  program will cause acreage to plummet Department feedgrain  analysts said.  There s no question that there will be a sharp decrease in  corn acreage one said. It s difficult for any farmer to not  go along with the program this year.  Soybean acreage is also expected to decline this year but  at a much slower rate of around four pct USDA analysts said.  Soybean plantings could drop to 59 mln acres or below they  said compared to last year s level of 61.5 mln acres.  If analysts unofficial estimates prove correct then the  drop in u.s. corn acreage will be the largest since 1983 when  farmers idled 22 mln acres in the Payment-In-Kind program.  Farmers planted only around 60 mln acres of corn in 1983. A  severe drought that summer in major producing states caused  yields to tumble and final crop production to total only 4.2  billion bushels.  Given normal weather conditions this year USDA analysts  said the 1987 corn crop could end up around seven billion  bushels down from last year s crop of 8.3 billion bushels.  This kind of acreage reduction will mean a significant  reduction in production an analyst said.  A crop of seven billion bushels is close to the annual U.S.  corn usage so surplus stocks while not decreasing would not  increase significantly a specialist said.  High producing corn belt states are expected to show the  greatest acreage reductions based upon historical  participation in government programs analysts said.  In contrast soybean acreage is likely to be cut the most  in marginal producing areas of the southeast and the western  corn belt a USDA soybean analyst said.  Soybean acreage in the eastern corn belt will not budge  he said. Neither does he expect any significant acreage cuts in  higher-producing delta areas.  Soybean production could drop fractionally from last year s  2.0 billion bushels to 1.8 to 1.9 billion he said.  U.S. soybean acreage after soaring to 71.4 mln acres in  1979 from only 52 mln acres five years prior to that has  steadily declined in the 1980 s.  U.S. corn acreage with the exception of 1983 has been in  the low to mid 80-mln acre range for the past 10 years. The  highest corn plantings reported in the 60 years that USDA has  kept such records was in 1932 when farmers planted 113 mln  acres and obtained average yields of 26.5 bushels per acre.  Last year U.S. farmers obtained record corn yields  averaging 119.3 bushels per acre.  We have absolutely no trouble producing an eight billion  bushel crop on only 80 mln acres or so an analyst said.  Corn acreage will probably level at around 65 mln acres as  long as government program provisions remain the same analysts  said.  Currently farmers enrolling in the program are required to  set aside 20 pct of their base acreage and then are eligible  for payments of two dlrs per bushel by idling an additional 15  pct of their acreage.  To get to the PIK level of 60 mln acres we would have to  provide more incentives an analyst said.    56\n",

      " U.S. SENATE PANEL APPROVES TRADE MISSION BILL  The U.S. Senate Agriculture  Committee approved a bill that would establish farm trade and  aid missions to promote the use of U.S. food aid donation  credit and export subsidy programs by overseas customers.  The bill approved by voice vote would establish trade  missions made up of representatives of the Departments of  Agriculture and State the Agency for International  Development the Overseas Private Investment Corp market  development cooperatives and private voluntary organizations.  At least 16 missions would have to be sent within one year  after enactment of the bill. The missions would promote U.S.  programs including PL480 Section 416 donations Export  Enhancement Program the dairy export incentive program and  export credit guarantee programs (GSM-102 GSM-103).  The panel agreed to drop a provision in the original bill  offered by Sen. John Melcher (D-Mont.) that would have  required the U.S. Agriculture Department to donate at least one  mln tonnes of surplus commodities to developing countries.  Current law requires USDA to donate at least 750 000 tonnes  of surplus grains and dairy products under the Section 416 food  donation program.  The Congressional Budget Office estimated that the proposed  increase in the minimum tonnage requirement would have cost up  to 50 mln dlrs per year Senate staff said.  The committee also dropped a provision identifying which  countries would be the focus of the trade missions activities.  Under the bill adopted by the committee countries friendly  to the United States would be eligible to host the trade  missions.  Melcher originally had proposed sending missions to Mexico  the Philippines Indonesia Bangladesh Senegal Nigeria Peru  Kenya the Dominican Republic Costa Rica Malaysia Venezuela  Tunisia and Morocco.  The bill also would require the Foreign Agricultural  Service FAS to have at least 850 full-time employees during  fiscal years 1987-89.

      " U.S. SUGAR POLICY MAY SELF-DESTRUCT CONGRESSMAN  A leading U.S. farm-state  Congressman Jerry Huckaby D-La. warned he will press next  year for legislation to control domestic production of  sweeteners perhaps including corn sweeteners if the industry  fails to voluntarily halt output increases this year.  We re moving toward a direction where we could  self-destruct (the U.S. sugar program) Rep. Huckaby chairman  of the House agriculture subcommittee dealing with sugar  issues told Reuters in an interview.  Huckaby who told U.S. sugarbeet growers earlier this year  they must halt production increases said he will deliver the  same message to Louisiana sugarcane growers Friday. He also  said he will soon talk with corn refiners on the subject.  Huckaby said the campaign to urge a halt to domestic  sweetener output increases is an effort to forestall further  cuts in the sugar import quota now at one mln short tons.  I think if we re talking about dropping (the quota)  another half mln tons lets say you re getting to the point  where the program might not work he said.  Ideally I d like to freeze things right where we are  said Huckaby leading advocate for sugar growers in Congress.  A freeze would mean domestic sugar production at about the  current level of 6.5 mln tons the corn sweetener share of the  U.S. market staying at just over 50 pct and U.S sugar imports  holding at about 1.2 mln tons Huckaby said.  A decision on whether to seek legislation will not be made  until 1987 output numbers are known late this year he said.  I feel like if we didn t expand production we could  probably hold where we are indefinitely or at least through  the 1985 farm bill without any changes (in the sugar program)  Huckaby said.  However much depends on whether high-fructose corn syrup  producers continue to expand their share of the U.S. sweetener  market from just over 50 pct Huckaby said.  He noted most estimates are that corn sweeteners will  capture at most only another 10 pct of the sweetener market in  the U.S.  But he said if there were an economic breakthrough in the  production of a new crystalline corn sweetener which further  expanded the corn sweetener share then U.S. sugar imports  might be eliminated and U.S. sugar output severely reduced.  Huckaby said he will deliver this message to corn refiner  companies such as A.E. Staley and Archer Daniels Midland soon.  This program is advantageous to the corn users. They have  some natural legitimate self-interest in seeing that the  program is preserved Huckaby said.  Huckaby said he has asked sugar industry representatives to  think about how domestic output could be controlled either  through production allocations acreage or marketing controls.  Huckaby also said he would be seeking guidance from the  Justice Department to determine if it would be legal to ask  corn refiners to limit production.  I don t know if we will go this route but if we do  there s a question in my mind at this point in time; can you do  that legally? he said.  Asked if he would proceed with production controls without  the support of corn refiners Huckaby said You build a fragile  house if you do it that way.  Huckaby said he understands why U.S. cane and beet farmers  have expanded production because high sugar price support  means returns from sugar are higher than competing crops such  as soybeans and grain.  But he said for sugar growers as a whole expansion would  not be good policy.  Huckaby said he has tried to stress in his speeches to  sugar industry groups that if growers continue to expand they  may be penalized retroactively under any production control  legislation passed next year.  Huckaby said Congress is unlikely to approve any changes in  the sugar program this year despite a Reagan administration  proposal to drastically slash the program.  The administration proposal is so drastic that I don t  think it will get up a head of steam Huckaby said.  He said even a more moderate proposal to reduce sugar price  support is unlikely to be approved.  Instead of seeking to slash the domestic sugar program  Huckaby said the Reagan administration should file a complaint  with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade against the  European Community s sugar policy. He said EC policies are the  major cause of the depressed world sugar market.    57\n",

      " ARGENTINE SOYBEAN YIELD ESTIMATES DOWN FURTHER  Argentine grain producers again  reduced their estimates for the total yield of the 1986/87  soybean crop which will begin to be harvested in mid-April  trade sources said.  They said growers now forecast soybean production this  season at between 7.5 and 7.8 mln tonnes down from last week s  estimate of 7.7 to eight mln tonnes and the 8.0 to 8.4 mln  tonnes forecast in mid-February.  The new forecast is still higher than last season s record  total production.  Private sources put 1985/86 production at a record 7.2 to  7.3 mln tonnes -- 4.2 to 6.4 pct lower than the new forecast  for the current crop. The official figure for 1985/86 is 7.1  mln tonnes 5.6 to 9.9 pct below this season s new estimates.  Growers in the past week discovered more empty soybean pods  in the main producing areas of southern Cordoba and Santa Fe  provinces and northern Buenos Aires.  The crop since January has been hit by high temperatures  and inadequate rainfall. Growers fear they may find more empty  pods and have to further reduce their forecasts of total yield.  The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 to  3.8 mln hectares 10.8 to 13.8 pct higher than the 1985/86  record of 3.34 mln hectares.  The state of the crop continued to be good in general until  last week but intense heavy rains since could have caused  damage in areas where rainfall was higher than 100 mm.  Where the rains were less heavy they were considered  beneficial although too late to improve yield estimates.  The rains also benefitted maize and sorghum crops in  southern Buenos Aires province but are not expected to  influence production forecasts.  In other areas especially western Buenos Aires where  rainfall was more than 200 mm parts of the sunflower maize  and sorghum crops not yet harvested may have been damaged.  The coarse grain crop harvest was interrupted last week by  rains which also reached over 100 mm in parts of Cordoba La  Pampa and Santa Fe and almost 90 mm in parts of Entre Rios.  The area sown with maize this season was between 3.58 and  3.78 mln hectares two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln  hectares in 1985/86.  The yield of 1986/87 maize continued to be forecast at  between 9.9 and 10.1 mln tonnes.  This estimate is 19.8 to 20.2 pct lower than the 12.4 to  12.6 mln tonnes at which private sources put 1985/86 production  and 21.1 to 22.7 pct lower than the official 12.8 mln tonnes.  The sunflowerseed harvest has covered 23 to 26 pct of the  area sown and continues in parts of central Buenos Aires  although at a standstill elsewhere due to rain and floods.  A resumption of full harvesting and assessment of damage is  impossible until rains stop and a spell of a week to 10 days of  sunshine dries the fields.  The area sown this season was 2.0 to 2.2 mln hectares down  29.9 to 36.3 pct on last year s record 3.14 mln hectares.  Sunflowerseed 1986/87 production is still forecast at 2.3  to 2.6 mln tonnes 34.1 to 41.5 pct below the 1985/86 record of  4.1 mln tonnes.  The grain sorghum harvest was the least affected by the  rains advancing steadily in Santa Fe and Cordoba and starting  in La Pampa to cover 14 to 16 pct of the total area sown.  The area sown was 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares 10.3 to 15.2  pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares the previous season.  Yield estimates remained at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes 16.7 to  22 pct down on 1985/86 production of 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes.    57\n",

      " COST OF PIK CERTIFICATES TO BE EYED BY CONGRESS  Congress eager to find budget  savings launches a review of the U.S. Agriculture Department s  generic commodity certificate program tomorrow amid signs USDA  and the General Accounting Office GAO are at odds over how  much the program has cost U.S. taxpayers.  The GAO concluded in a preliminary report last week that  payment-in-kind or PIK certificates cost between five and 20  pct more than cash outlays administration officials who asked  not to be identified said.  USDA officials however took issue with the report saying  it did not take into account storage handling and transport  savings that accrue to the government. The GAO then decided to  re-examine the costs sources said.  The issue is an important one because congressional budget  committees are known to be considering limiting the use of  certificates as a means of cutting spending.  Agriculture Under Secretary Daniel Amstutz and GAO Senior  Associate Director Brian Crowley are set to testify before the  Senate Agriculture Committee tomorrow.  Amstutz is expected to tell the committee that there are  uncertainties in determining the cost of certificates compared  to cash outlays and that savings to the Commodity Credit Corp  CCC almost equal costs department sources said.  USDA estimates that it costs the government about 75 cents  to store handle and transport each bushel of commodity put in  government storage.  It was unclear whether the GAO Congress investigative  arm would stick by its original analysis that it costs the  government more to use certificates instead of cash in farm  price and income support programs Reagan administration  sources said.  The GAO is expected to point out that use of  payment-in-kind PIK certificates has helped relieve tight  storage by moving grain that otherwise might not have been  sold.  The testimony by Amstutz and GAO Senior Associate Director  Brian Crowley comes as congressional budget committees  intensify their efforts to pinpoint ways to cut the federal  budget deficit -- including considering limits on the use of  PIK certificates.  The CCC issues dollar-denominated PIK certificates or  certs as a partial substitute for direct cash outlays to  farmers or cash subsidies to exporters. Certs can be used to  repay nonrecourse loans or exchanged for CCC commodities or  cash.  Between April and December 1986 CCC issued 3.8 billion  dlrs worth of certificates according to USDA. Up to another  6.7 billion dlrs worth could be issued between January and  August 1987 according to USDA.  Certs can cost the government more than cash primarily  because recipients can use the certificates to pay back  government loans at levels below the loan rate.  Eliminating this practice called PIK and roll would save  the government 1.4 billion dlrs between 1988-92 according to  the Congressional Budget Office CBO. That estimate according  to a CBO official was based on an assumption that certificates  cost the government about 15 pct more than cash payments.  The Senate and House Budget Committees are known to be  considering curbs on PIK-and-roll transactions among other  savings alternatives.  The GAO last week reached the tentative conclusion that the  estimated three billion dlrs of certificates redeemed to date  have cost the federal government between 150 mln and 600 mln  dlrs or between five and 20 pct more than cash outlays one  administration official said.  However the GAO has decided to reassess those estimates  based in part on USDA criticism department officials said.  The broad range of the cost estimate is partly attributable  to the different effect certificates can have on market prices  over the course of a crop year.  USDA s Economic Research Service for example has found  that between June and August last year the 215 mln bushels of  corn exchanged for certificates lowered the price of corn by  between 35 and 45 cents per bushel.  Between September and November however certificates had  only a marginal impact on corn prices according to the ERS  study obtained by Reuters.    57\n",

      " IWC LIFTS WORLD GRAIN OUTPUT ESTIMATE TO RECORD  The International Wheat Council (IWC)  lifted its estimate for 1986/87 world wheat and coarse grain  production by one mln tonnes to a record 1 377 mln compared  with 1 351 mln tonnes the previous season.  In its monthly market report the IWC said it is leaving  unchanged its forecast of world wheat production for the coming  1987/88 season at between 520 and 530 mln tonnes against a  record 534 mln in 1986/87. The one mln tonne upward revision in  1986/87 wheat production reflects several minor adjustments.  The IWC raised the 1986/87 coarse grain trade figure two mln to  87 mln tonnes. It left wheat trade unchanged at 86 mln.  The IWC 1986/87 estimate for world trade in wheat and  coarse grain is thus estimated two mln tonnes higher at 173 mln  against 169 mln the previous season with the forecast three mln  rise in Soviet imports offset by small reductions elsewhere.  The IWC said the area harvested for wheat in 1987/88 is  likely to be down from last year as low world prices and  restrictive national policies measures begin to take effect.  At least four of the five major exporters expect to see a  drop in wheat sowings without offset in other countries. There  is still potential for even higher average wheat yields but the  IWC said there are increasing signs world output may level off.  Although it is still early to assess the coarse grain  outlook the IWC said barley acreage is likely to fall in the  European Community but increase in Canada. U.S. Maize area is  expected lower but oat sowings could rise.  After damage to its maize crop last year the Soviet Union  plans to expand this area by as much as 50 pct to over six mln  hectares in a year when many frost damaged wheat fields are  likely to be resown to this and other spring crops. Improved  weather and a further increase in the use of intensive  cultivation methods could therefore see a marked rise in Soviet  maize output in 1987 the IWC said.  Any reduction in world coarse grain output would be  bolstered by the large carryover stocks from 1986/87 the IWC  said.  It left its estimates of wheat and coarse grain stocks at  endof different marketing years unchanged at 178 and 210 mln  tonnes respectively against 160 and 167 mln a year earlier.  After record world durum wheat production of 218.8 mln  tonnes last season the IWC said there are already signs of  another large crop this coming season with higher output  expected in the EC Canada the U.S. And North Africa.    57\n",

      " IWC SAYS EFFECT OF LOWER SUPPORT PRICES LIMITED  Efforts by governments to control wheat  surpluses by cutting support prices have met with only partial  success the International Wheat Council (IWC) says in its  latest monthly report.  Faster results could be achieved by a policy of reducing  both price and areas as employed in the United States the IWC  says in a survey of support prices in the five main wheat  exporters - Argentina Australia Canada the EC and the U.S.  In some countries for example Australia and Argentina  which are highly dependent on wheat shipments for export  income there may be problems in reducing production.  A policy of cutting wheat production could lead to  unemployment with job prospects outside agriculture limited.  Alternative crops may offer inferior returns which could then  lead to lost export revenue and balance of payments problems.  The IWC outlines three courses of action open to  governments in wheat exporting countries.  They could continue to support prices in the hope that when  the world economy improves demand for wheat will rise and  surpluses wil be reduced or eliminated.  Alternatively support could be limited to wheat which  could be easily sold without needing to be stored for a long  period.  This option may prove to be the most politically  unattractive and would result in many producers abandoning  wheat production the report said.  The third option would be for governments to distinguish  between the commercial and social aspects of agriculture  possibly varying support prices according to farm size or  overall production.  The IWC review covers support prices in the major exporting  countries since 1982. At some time during that period all the  producers cut support prices in response to growing surpluses.  These changes did not always result in lower export  subsidies as on several occasions currency fluctuations more  than offset lower prices in the domestic currency.  For example between 1985/86 and 1986/87 the EC intervention  price for bread wheat fell from 209.30 to 179.44 European  currency units (Ecus). It dollar terms the currency in which  most export transactions are denominated the intervention  price however rose to 193 dlrs from 168. The high cost of  supporting farm prices has put a strain on national exchequers  and some governments are now searching for ways to cut  expenditure the report says.  The proportion of world wheat output produced by the five  major exporters declined in the period covered by the survey  from 40 pct in 1982 to 35 pct in 1987. This was partly due to  increased production in China and India.  The period saw an upward trend in yields although this was  countered in the Argentina the U.S. And Australia by lower  acreages.  In Argentina a reduction in the sown area of about 20 per  cent was put down to low prices causing producers to switch to  other enterprises particularly livestock while lower U.S.  Acreages are attributed to official incentives.    57\n",

      " DUTCH GRAIN LEVY TEST CASE TO START IN APRIL  A large Dutch animal feed compounder  will begin formal legal proceedings early next month as a test  case on the way the EC grain co-responsibility levy is applied  a spokesman for Dutch grain and feed trade association Het  Comite told Reuters.  Het Comite has been co-ordinating national actions against  alleged distortions caused by currency factors in the levy and  since December has lodged more than 80 individual cases with  the Business Appeal Court in The Hague.  The basic complaint is that the levy does not take account  of currency cross-rates of exchange and therefore compounders  in countries with strong currencies may have to pay more in  their own currency than is paid to them by producers in another  country.  Het Comite has obtained a temporary agreement that  companies can pay the amount they receive toward the levy  rather than paying a full guilder amount to the Dutch grain  commodity board.  The spokesman said Het Comite will provide financial and  legal backing to the test case in the Business Administration  Court in the Hague. Oral proceedings are to begin on April 10.  The spokesman said Het Comite finally selected the company  for the test case from among the 80 lodged because the bill  (the firm) received from the commodity board for payment of the  levy contained significant currency distortions and involved  grain from a wide variety of origins. The name of the company  is not being made public.  The Administration Court is not expected to make a final  ruling on the case in the near future. The Het Comite spokesman  said it was very likely it would refer questions to the Appeal  Court in Luxembourg and as a result it could easily be another  nine to 12 months before the matter is finally resolved.  Meanwhile the actions by Dutch animal feed compounders are  putting pressure on the commodity board to urge the Dutch  government to follow through on earlier statements and seek a  complete review in Brussels of the way in which the levy is  collected the spokesman said.  Het Comite as a member of FEFAC the association of  European animal feed manufacturers is also a party to actions  protesting the whole levy in the Luxembourg appeal court.    58\n",
